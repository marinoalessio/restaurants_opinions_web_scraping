# Restaurants Opinions Web Scraping - Features Analysis through Social Networks

This project aims to scrape people's opinions through social networks, related to a specific topic: in our case, about restaurants.

### Which platforms to get people's opinions?

**Twitter** and **TripAdvisor**. 

This choice is because:
- Having a second source is great for having more accurate data
- Twitter may not have much data available, sometimes it can be infrequent to leave a thought on Twitter about a restaurant
- Not all tweets may be relevant or a restaurant name is not unique and there may be more than one with the same name

### Why Features?

We are interested in offering businesses a careful analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of their business, furthermore, to orient the clients' choice.
So seeing which features are the most satisfactory and which ones are less.
