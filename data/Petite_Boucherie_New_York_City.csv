3,"It was a Great experience! Great Food, excellent Service and a Cosy atmosphere !!! A Perfect recommendation!"
4,Tiny little restaurant but it packs quite a punch. Onion soup is a must and I would also recommend the spicy shrimp linguine. 10/10 experience from the wait staff to the desserts. Will try to come back next time I’m in NYC with my wife.
5,In a calmer area of NYC - this little cosy restaurant is perfect for a bite. Loved it - good quality food and well priced !!
6,It’s a great spot to go with your partner for a date. Beautiful atmosphere and great service. The burrata was delicious. Coming back for sure

12,"Highly recommended!!! Delicious food, efficient and friendly customer service, especially Evica , and great atmosphere! In other words, a place to enjoy and make memories!"
13,"When we were visiting America, in addition to other beautiful places, I have to mention you as a renowned restaurant, that day when our relatives brought us for lunch, I am a big fan of roast pork, you amazed me with your skillful cuisine, a wonderful atmosphere with your kind staff, big praise for your esteemed Eva, with a big smile on her face you served us impeccably and tirelessly. I highly recommend and every next occasion is inevitably my presence again with my family  have wonderful moments"
14,"We were some friends, and had full courses. The waiter was really nice and on point and took good care of us, and the food was fresh and tasty. The wine, also worth it!"
15,Amazing place to enjoy dinner and lunch the staff are amazing excellent service and Evica is an amazing person with her team. Highly recommend the restaurant.
16,"Definitely one of the best places I've been in New York.The food is delicious and the staff cannot be more polite,helpful,fun and most of all professional. Kudos to all the staff especially the blond lady Eva who made sure our family had unforgettable experience."
17,"Going in Petite Boucherie in NYC it made me feel like I am in Paris in a same time . Such a cozy place, staff is so warm ambience is amazing . They have the best cocktails highly reccommend La Vie En Rose and must try the french onion soup ! Thank you Eva ! We will come back"
18,"My family and I visited Petite for dinner and we had such a great time! The food was delicious, so flavorful. We ordered the escargots, the lamb chops, and the linguini pasta. The servers were super accommodating and kind. The atmosphere was lovely and it was not too loud either. 100% recommend! Thank you staff of Petite, we’ll be returning back!"
19,We come here every time we come to the city !!! My most favorite spot. The staff is sooo welcoming and professional. One of the best hamburgers I have ever had. I also love the charcuterie plate. Oops and the Pinot Noir! Please stop by. Excellent!
20,"On our last visit to NYC, we stumbled onto Petite Boucherie. From the second we walked in, we knew we found a gem. The restaurant is small, quaint very cozy and reminded us of our favorite bistro in Paris. What makes this restaurant so special is the staff. Dan and Paola, we love you. Our last visit was one year ago to the day. We will definitely be back on November 27, 2023. As for the food, the rack of lamb was crazy!!!!"
21,"My partner and I have been to boucherie many times and it was our first time at the petite location. I absolutely love the ambience at this location. This one has around 15 tables and is very intimate. You can tell how much detail each server puts into each table here. My favorite thing here is definitely the ravioli, if you like truffle is a MUST! Before moving back to NYC it was the highlight of my trip. Special thanks to Eva, as she made our date night very special. She knew we were celebrating and even brought over one of their boucherie books that now proudly sits on our coffee table! I love how much each person enjoys working here and how kind they are. I can’t recommend boucherie enough, and now I have to say go to the petite location!"
22,"Excellent service, the place is lovely and the food is delicious. Ask for Daniel when you come in. You’ll love it."
23,Really yummy thanksgiving meal!! Great service and great food in a very cute area of West Village :)
24,"Merely awful….. Nothing in this so called restaurant is worth the huge amount of bucks you will leave in… The most significant thing is the poor quality of meat. Would it be with the burger (which litteraly stinks) or the Tartare, which is so salted that is suspicious, this restaurant’s reputation, if a y, is far from beeing justified. It took me nearly one day to get rid of that awful taste in my mouth, and since, I’m praying not to get sick about."
25,Great classic French food! Very good service ran by Ozzy and William! Wonderful setting and location! The escargot and pate were incredible
26,"I went here with a group of girlfriends to celebrate a birthday, and it was a perfect quintessential New York night. I’ve been living in New York for many years, and I love going to Petite Boucherie, the service is always on point, the food is always delicious, and it is just the right size to feel the energy of those around you and feel the energy and personality of the village, without being overwhelming or too loud. I absolutely love the location, as it is a perfect walking distance from the subway, along with many other local attractions that make for a perfect girls night out. We loved the charcuterie board, the burger, and of course the onion soup and escargot which, in my humble opinion, are THE BEST IN THE CITY. if you’re traveling through NYC, be sure to stop here for brunch, lunch or dinner."
27,Dan was super friendly and accommodating! We ordered the onion soup as a starter and had the Ravioli as a main course. The crème brûlée was so yummy. We’ll definitely be back soon!
28,"The place is so romantic, especially at night time. I went there with ny best friend last night and we had an incredible time."
29,"High price for mediocre food. Ordered a couple steaks with frites. The meat was unevenly cooked, and the fries with ketchup tasted like McDonald’s. Furthermore, the mussels was of medium quality, but for a twist suprise the ravioli was really good and boosting this review to a three star instead of two."
30,"Cute little restaurant with delicious food. We had the lamb which was perfectly made and very tasty. Called in advance to reserve a table, probably not needed for the Monday when we visited. Friendly waitress and an overall romantic experience. Would absolutely recommend!"
31,"Great brunch experience with my family, escargots and Steak frites it’s a must to have, thank you so much Boucherie for being so special with us"
32,"My husband and I were walking in the area and stopped by for an early lunch. We had a croque madame and a croque champignons, each with a poached egg on top. They were both delicious and accompanied by a small salad. We had a glass of rose each. Very good service and wonderful atmosphere and food!"
33,"It's the American version of a French restaurant, but never comparable to a real French restaurant. The sauce of the Bourguignon was so strong that we everything else on the plate 'disappeared'. The Stake Tartar was very boring, comes with a quail egg, not even a mollet egg. Not tasty at all. The fries are very American, with a lot of oil, and served with a regular ketchup. Pricey and very bad. Don't trust this foolish rate on TripAdvisor. The place and atmosphere although is good."
34,"This place is great! Fast service, kind and helpful staff, and delicious food! I had the steak aux oeufs, and I can’t wait to come back!"
35,"Beautiful ambiences, delicious food and drinks, fast and friendly service. A west village gem and would recommend to anyone"
36,"I sat at the bar and enjoyed a meal and aperol spritz in such a lovely ambience with upbeat jazz playing and a cool breeze. First I had the warmest welcome by the hostess, Clarissa, then I was served kindly and attentively by the bartender, Daniel. It was overall a great experience and can’t wait to be back!"
37,"the atmosphere and service were phenomenal, food and excellent drinks. ideal for dinner or dinner……. Really I’ll come back"
38,"We were there on a rainy Saturday and although we could only get a table outdoors we still enjoyed our lunch. The service was excellent and the food very good. We enjoyed the onion soup, escargot, steak & fries, creme brulée and chocolate cake. Reservations a must."
39,This is place is amazing ! Steak fritz is just  Atmosphere is so cool and relaxing even though you are in the west village …. I will come back
40,"Amazing experience! Sat at the bar to have a drink and I ended up having a 3 course meal! Great service from bartender Denny, he was very attentive and sweet with me and everyone at the bar. Food was very good too and came out o perfect timing. Definitely coming back to this tiny and cute place in west village."
41,"We had a delicious dinner, with excellent service. We sat in the outdoor area and it was cosy and atmospheric. A good time had by all!"
42,I visited with a friend and first start to finish the service was fantastic! Claudia was our server and she went above and beyond with great recommendations! She recommend a beautiful Chardonnay and lemon tart. Will definitely be back here!!
43,Great service. Great good. Lovely atmosphere. Lemon tart for dessert was divine. Loved the Le vie en rose cocktail also.
44,"such a lovely place with amazing food and ambiance ❣️ Paola gave exceptional service, I’ll be back to this charming corner"
45,"Great attention!! excellent food and cocktails! The bartender was awesome!! If you are in nyc, that place is a must in the bucket list"
46,Visited from Seattle and stopped here for a couple drinks! And it ended up being one of my best experiences in nyc! Food and drinks are amazing + staff gave me the best service I’ve had! Must try if you are around! Ask for Daniel the bartender!
47,"Very cute looking place but what is the most important the service was immaculate. Friendly staff and delicious food, a perfect combo!"
48,"The atmosphere was amazing. Daniel was our Bartender and took great care of us. Made amazing cocktails. We ordered the Ratatouille and the Burger, was phenomenal. The manager Jelena hustles to make sure she talks to all the guests and the experience is top notch. Will definitely be back Next week for my weekly friends get together!! Thanks guys!"
49,The service could not have been better and the atmosphere was stunning. The drinks were delicious and the bread is next to none. I would highly recommend here to anyone.
50,"This is always the perfect solution to the eternal question “Where to go?” Delicious food, paired with exquisite cocktails (the Provence Martini is a must-try) & warm and welcoming staff make this spot perfect for the everyday meal and for special occasions alike."
51,"We have visited France several times in the last year, yet this French Bistro tops them. My wife had the Chateaubriand ( she’s from Texas and kowns her beef) and said it was the best steak she’s had in years! All our meals were delicious, the cocktails satisfying ( La rose en vie was a highlight) , and the shared desserts a perfect ending. We called the manager ( Eva) over at the end of the meal to compliment her on our overall experience. She approached the table with trepidation, because who bothers to say anything positive anymore… she was giddy in her reaction , and the whole team deserves it. Highly recommend!"
52,Excelent service food and drinks amazing Luis and Daniel make it better we have some drinks and food !!
53,"Good food, good drinks. We sat at the bar initially since we arrived early for our reservation. We got the steak tartare, moules frites, and burrara salad."
54,Great service from Claudia! Beautiful place to hangout. The Boucherie Old fashioned it's just a must.
55,"Such a lovely experience - really delicious food, lovely atmosphere. Server Claudia was brilliant and so friendly!! Really recommend."
56,As a French person I was very impressed by the quality of the food at Petite Boucherie. The burger is phenomenal and so are the mussels. To top it all off our server Antonio was absolutely lovely. Highly recommend!
57,Amazing atmosphere! The food is incredible. The staff are so friendly and accommodating. My favorite spot in the city.
58,"A very cute French restaurant with intimate settings, dimmed lights and delicious tasting food. I had the lamb ratatouille and mussels that were phenomenal. Will def me coming back!"
59,"The meal of mussels and lamb sausage was delightful. Our server, Roberto, went above and beyond to show us wonderful time. Will be back again"
60,Wonderful experience and good service! Had the mussels and onion soup and it tasted amazing. Definitely would recommend!
61,"The food was really great! I had the French onion soup and the ravioli, and for dessert, the lemon tart. Will definitely come back again!"
62,"Excellent, menu choices top shelf, excellent pie hole watering area, big branch down the street, I’ve done both, 1 bathroom though……."
63,"The bartenders and staff. Obviously this is the best vibe in NYC, but the staff truly makes it. Daniel is our favorite and we only go when he is working! Everyone is so friendly, genuinely. And the food and drinks are SO GOOD."
64,"We went with a friends for a dinner. We were in the city for a few days. The whole ambience , cocktails, food were outstanding . The lady who served us Paola she was fabulous. Thank you Boucherie Team thank you Paola !"
65,"Lovely spot! One of my favorite in the west village. Cocktails are so good. The staff is always so welcoming, would recommend for a romantic dinner or brunch with friends on the weekend."
66,We went with my friends for dinner and literally all of us really enjoyed. Service was very attentive but not bothered too much and the food is to die for. I am going back definitely when I go to NYC again.
67,"The food it’s so good and the service is amazing, all servers are kind persons! The place and the ambience is great and i definitely will come back"
68,Happened upon this adorable restaurant while walking around in the West Village. They were super accommodating even though we didn’t have a reservation.  The menu wasn’t massive but we still had the hardest time deciding on what to order. So many delicious options. I opted for the onion soup and the duck breast while my friend got the mesclun salad and the squid ink pasta. We basically shared everything because it all looked so good. Honestly might be my favorite duck breast preparation I’ve ever had. It was served with shishito peppers and sweet corn. It was such a great flavor combination.  We thought we were too full for dessert but our lovely waitress suggested the lemon tart and it was the perfect size for us to share. The manager Yelena introduced herself to us and welcomed us so kindly and offered us coffee.  In the end 10/10 from the service to the setting to the food. Would highly recommend and will certainly be back again.
69,"The restaurant overall is perfect.The food is delicious and the staff super friendly. The one person who stands out of the crowd is Evica,she has been above and beyond in everything. Absolutely amazing experience. Definitely we are going back when we are back in town."
70,"This place really does feel like a secret Paris getaway right in the heart of NYC. The Sunday brunch was delicious and coffee was absolutely perfect. The part that made my experience most exceptional however was the people who work there. My server Claudia was super accommodating, friendly and fun. The manager Jelena made me feel like I was a special guest and was everyone welcomed me with the warmest smile. The bartender Paula was so sweet and all in all there is such a wonderful, cosy, welcoming atmosphere in the place I can’t wait to become a regular and to bring more of my friends and family. Thank you for a brilliant Sunday brunch experience le petit boucherie team :)"
71,Went with my boy !! For him first time and definitely we will come back. The team and food was perfect. Can’t wait to be back
72,"Had an amazing birthday brunch! Food was excellent, place is cozy but vibrant at the same time. Roberto A. was excellent as our server. He provided helpful tips, was super attentive, and helped us had a fantastic experience. Will return and hopefully have Roberto with us again!"
73,"I took my girlfriend here for the first time and she loved it. I’ve been here several times to visit the best bartender I know, Daniel. What a champ. He mixed up incredible cocktails and told us exactly what food to order. Incredible evening and a happy girlfriend. Go here!"
74,"My boyfriend and I came in to have dinner and drinks. Daniel, the bartender, makes great cocktails and knows exactly what to order. My boyfriend has been here multiple times and raved about it. I finally had the chance to check it out with him. We’ll be back! The best first, second, fifth, sixtieth date night spot in the West Village!"
75,Best drinks from Daniel. Recommended 100%. All drinks a very good and you have to try them at least once. I love the service and the service its really good.
76,"I came just to have a quick dinner but I found an amazing cocktail list, Daniel the bartender was really nice explaining me each of the cocktails, i had the Boucherie Old Fashioned which was amazing, i definitely gonna come back !"
77,"I hate to write a critical review, but we were quite disappointed by our dinner at Petite Boucherie, primarily due to how we were treated. When we arrived, the host who checked us in (and ended up being our server) was quite confrontational, insisting that we had a reservation for two people instead of four. Yet we had rescheduled our original reservation (for four) from earlier in the week, requesting the change when our flight to New York was delayed, so the restaurant must have accidentally changed the number of people in our reservation. Mistakes happen, and that part didn't bother us at all, but we were taken aback by the host's attitude. We were ultimately seated at the table directly next to the front door, which was honestly so cold that it should have been the very last table filled. Seating us there would have been fine in a completely booked restaurant, which we assumed that it was, but it turned out that there were multiple open tables in the heart of the restaurant that went unused the entire time that we were there. Each time other patrons entered the restaurant, they were asked whether they wanted the table next to us or another table farther inside, and they all opted for interior tables. But we were never asked. Clearly, we were stuck by the door as punishment for a mistake that we hadn't even made. We probably should have left, but we wanted to honor our reservation, so we put our coats and hats back on so that the constant freezing blasts of air from the door bothered us less. But it kind of ruined the evening. The food was good, but not great. We enjoyed the French onion soup and salmon. But the salad nicoise was incredibly average and the burger overdone. All of our other dining experiences in New York were exceptional, though, so please read my other restaurant reviews!"
78,"We have a house in France and this was one of the best French meals we have had anywhere in the world. We loved the idea of coming down to Greenwich and the building - both inside and outside - could have been in a Woody Allen movie. Really great food - snails and lamb for me, onion soup and mussels for Nathalie - and a very good bottle of wine. Waitress Claudia was wonderful, as was waiter Ali. If we lived in New York we would make this our local."
79,"In love with this place the food was excellent, I tried the steak frites and la vie en rose it was delicious, the service was perfect our server Luis was very attentive and efficient."
80,"We happened to wander in for a late lunch. Everything was just exactly what we wished. The food was excellent (especially the duck), the service was relaxed and efficient, the atmosphere welcoming and interesting."
81,"Service 100%, food and wine quality 100%, ambience 100%, 100% friendly staff. Definitely coming back to this place. Loved it."
82,"excellent attention, the first drink was a unique experience the name is Le diable cocktail you need to try it, thanks Enrique a the bartender for everything"
83,I have been in Petite Boucherie couple of times and always have great dining. It is so cozy and charming. Just booked another dinner so excited !
84,"Amazing service and cocktails. Daniel, the bartender, served up some great drinks and made great conversation. I felt completely at home here and spent four hours here! I will keep coming back."
85,So delicious!! Loved the food and the service was even better!! Would recommend to everyone …. Get espresso martinis!!!
86,"Grey food, staff is amazing would recommend to anyone for a great Pre-drinks and dinner night out! Espresso martinis are a must"
87,Always good and nice worker there !!! I got the magret de canard and was delicious. Can’t wait to go back at petite !!!!!!!
88,Had the most amazing cocktails and charcuterie board here! Fantastic service and beautiful ambience. Would highly recommend!
89,"Had the La Vie En Rose and several dishes. The ratatouille, charcuterie and mesclun au chèvre chauffeur are incredible as well as the plat principaux. Will be coming back!"
90,I highly recommend. The menu is varied and everything was delicious (I was with my wife and son and each of our meals was fantastic). Delicious food and great service. A wonderful meal. Thanks!
91,"I was really looking forward to eating here. It is a quaint little spot in the Village and the menu sounded interesting without being overwhelming. We were having a great trip to NYC, unfortunately the experience we had at this establishment did not measure up.  My wife had the Chateubriand, which was good, if uninspired (it is hard to go wrong when you start with a good cut of meat). I had the Branzino en Papillote. This was terrible. It was completely flavorless, the fish and vegetables were overcooked with some bites being watery and some greasy. To top it all off, the service was awful. We had to wait a long time for our order to be taken, a long time for the food to arrive (luke warm), they forgot the glass of wine I ordered. To end the evening we waited and waited for the check, we then asked one of the wait staff, who said she would bring it right away and then had to wait quite a bit longer. We asked another member of the wait staff, who sort of laughed it off. To their credit, they did comp our desert (mousse au chocolat, which was good). However, for the prices you pay at an establishment such as this, an awful entree and sub par service just ruin the evening. I definitely would not recommend this restaurant."
92,"It was our first time here in NYC and a friend recommended this restaurant to us. The food was amazing, no regrets, the bartender Daniel was very good making my favorite drink (old fashioned) and the manager really sweet and attentive, onion soup it’s a must and the truffle ravioli to die. 100% recommended."
93,Not recommended. Very dirty and unkept kitchen. Saw it after I ate and didn’t want to ever come back. Decent food. Nothing special. Low quality cuts of meat.
94,Exceptional French Food in New York City's West Village. Traditional French dishes and an admirable wine list in one of the best locations in the West Village. Indoor and outdoor dining.
95,"The service is amazing, the GM is so accommodating, the staff are very Trained. Im coming back again. Love this cozy place."
96,"This place is so cozy and such a beautiful decor. We loved the dining experience. Food and service were outstanding! Highly recommend for everyone who knows what is real dining. ""Petite"" franche experience in the heart of NYC."
97,"One star. The only reason for one is for the ambiance - the decor is very nice, especially on the outside area. Outside of that, our service was abysmal. Not one time did our server ask how our food was, if we wanted another drink, if we would like to see a dessert menu, or if he could get us anything else. If he would have asked any of these questions we would have told him that the octopus appetizer we ordered was beyond bland. - no salt, no seasoning and the so called grilled octopus had no char and tasted like it had been sitting in muck for so long that the skin was slimy and fatty, like we were just chewing on gelatin - inedible. Our entree, which was just the simple burger, was fine, and that's all. Cooked perfectly, thankfully, but again not much to it. The frites that came as the side were hard as rocks from being over cooked. The wine, cab for me, Pinot for my husband were bitter and tart and we would have liked to have sent them back, but for the server never saying a word to us for the entire meal - he didn't even bring us our food or drinks. We cannot understand how this restaurant has any good reviews."
98,"What a beautiful charming neighborhood restaurant! I just moved to the area and decided to have a bite with a friend, the wine and cocktails are well thought out, the sparkling rose was delicious and refreshing for a hot spring evening , I’ve had the mussel which were simplicity at its best, staff was attentive and on point with their pleasant service! Thank you and I think I might of found my regular spot!"
99,Really good as usual. Escargots and lamb shops amazing. Service was great. Thanks Nikola (our server) and Eli (our busser) for everything .
100,"Met with a two of my friends over there. Atmosphere at the restaurant was so lovely and lively and made our meeting even more interesting. Food, drinks, people along with nice ambience made this day memorable. Had a nice chat with a waitress, very friendly and pleasant person. Helped us a lot with wine recommendations. All in all, a must visit west village gem.  Merci Boucherie, we will see you soon!"
101,"Beautiful Boucherie, amazing staff and gorgeous atmosphere! Happy Holidays guys! Food is amazing as always!"
102,"This was my first time visiting Petite Boucherie, but it won't be the last. The restaurant is really cute, the staff amazing, and the food delicious! I had a great burrata salad and octopus this time. I can also recommend steak fritz, it's really good."
103,Rainy day but Inside was super charming and very welcoming thx again !!! Team and food always good !!
104,"I haven’t been here since the whole covid thing and I have to say this visit did not disappoint. The staff, Sophie and Jeremy are amazing and took really good care of me and the food remain as good as I remember! So Kudos to the team."
105,Really good food and service like always . They did a really good job with Covid 19 with social distance and dividers
106,Good food !! Amazing service and the patio was feel like in paris love it !!! Cant wait to come back
107,Very good service. Exelent place to eat and visit. I will go again for sure. I recomend this to anyone that likes exelent food
108,"The best experience ive ever had so far during covid. They take precautions very seriously. Amazing service, food and the manager was making sure we are comfortable with our dining experience."
109,Service and food was amazing! Greatly hosted by the manager and highly recommend this place! It is perfectly divided for social distancing!
110,"Excellent service, delicious food and great desserts!! Really amazing experience and great social distancing place."
111,"If you're looking for authentic French cuisine, this is the place. The staff is amazingly friendly, and the food is superb. A perfect night out."
112,"Base in Manhattan since beg of the year, i dedicate that place as my second home. Kitchen always fresh and tasty. All staff amazing and respectful. Many thanks to them btw."
113,"I go here for a piece of Paris in NYC. It's authentically French, I love the interior, the food, the wine, and the happy French staff Bilal and Micka (and their cute French accents)"
114,I just want to thank the two gentlemen who turned our night around. Bilal and Micka you are godsend I'm sending all my contacts over. Go see for yourself
115,"Had an excellent suggestion of wine pairing for the dishes we chose. The papardelles and the lamb were divine. Staff members were really professional, friendly and made me feel like if I were home. Strongly recommend this place! Thanks again for the excellent service"
116,"Being French it is hard to find (true) good French cuisine in New York. We went to this place for a Saturday night as recommended by friends... and were pleasantly surprised as it combines both friendly service AND great food (please try their niçoise... definitely the best around here ! And we even ended up with an extra side order of fries, given how great the one we intended to share tasted). The weekly specials selection made me feel like in Paris again. The bar is cute and cosy, and the bartender provided great wine reco as well. Thanks to everyone, I think we found our go-to sport and we’ll definitely be back !"
117,"Perfect restaurant to host intimate brunch, lunch and dinner meeting/celebrations. I frequent Petite Boucherie for business meetings, family and friend events and catch-up drinks. The Chateaubriand is magnifique!"
118,"My wife and I absolutely love this restaurant. The location is an easy find, inside is super cute with a cozy feel. Service is fast and obviously the food is amazing."
119,"So glad I returned! This was my second dinner at PB. The first was about a year and a half ago. The menu had been changed and it was all good changes. Not that any needed to be made! The restaurant was alive with each table full and only two seats at the bar. It has not lost its charm, the staff is still wonderful and informative, and it’s charm is still warm and welcoming. Our meals were perfect. The two bottles of Chablis were delicious. A lovely lovely place to dine."
120,"Small and cozy bistro on the corner of Christopher and Gay St. Staff was friendly and personable. Food is phenomenal, have visited a few times and have never been disappointed. They frequently feature weekly specials which makes this place a great. I would recommend the linguine pasta, rack of lamb, or the filet mignon. For dessert, a chocolate mousse!"
121,"What's not to love. A hidden gem, located on arguably the most quaint street in the most quaint neighborhood in NYC. Embued with a frenchness that transports you to a local bistrot. Populated by a bartender, waiters and regulars that embody Cheers (as far as a ""French Cheers"" can get). Excellent libations and food. Be sure to say hi to Sophie and Mika and have them make your night."
122,I had the poitrine de poulet sautée as a special was unbelievable !! The atmosphere and the stafff are amazing and great as always !! Can’t wait to come back !!!
123,I was there few days ago with some friends from out of town. I been there a few times and food still amazingly delicious and the staff were very nice and friendly. Still one of my favorite French restaurant in NYC. Highly recommended.
124,Another great evening at Petite Boucherie. The food is still great and service is top notch. Never disappoints. Definitely one of my favorite French bistro in New York. Highly recommended.
125,"I think it s my 4th time in petite Boucherie, and as usual I had an amazing time. This time I had a four way onion salad and a pan seared mokfish, both in the weekly specials and amazing. They also proposed me to get a chance win a trip for 2 to Paris by posting a photo on their Instagram showing what makes a romantic date... finger cross!"
126,"I came in for a quick lunch and felt immediately transported back to France with its rustic and cozy vibes! I had the burger (wish I got a picture!), it was perfectly cooked and the fries were crisped to perfection. Service was on point and and very welcoming. Highly recommend for a romantic date or even just a lunch with friends! I can’t wait to come back!"
127,"Beautiful authentic French bistrot. I had a wonderful experience, the service and food were excellent. I will definitely come back. Thank you !"
128,"Underwhelming in total yet a great atmosphere for a small French cafe. Service is spotty. Food average tasting, served cold , and not prepared properly. How the heck can one mess up steak frites and a burger, they make hundreds in a month yet screw it up. Service inconsistent, plus with verbal excuses for their inability to deliver a complete dining experience. Plenty of french restaurants in nyc to choose from for dining. Go for coffee, pastry, at the wee bar."
129,Tried the main restaurant and was busy so managed to get a table for lunch on Sunday via opentable.  It’s a much smaller place- degree of French rusticness.  There was a lunch menu but opted for the Foie Gras- was good.  Has a Cote de rhone red.  Service was good.
130,Picked this restaurant for a birthday celebration based on TripAdvisor reviews! Perfection is every way... felt like an afternoon trip to Paris without leaving NYC
131,Nice little restaurant .We were there for lunch 2 of us including me enjoyed our meals 2 were not satisfied with the food. I agreed their meals were sub par.could have been an off day
132,"Stopped by for an excellent lunch. The escargot was fresh and divinely garlicky, the onion soup was light and savory, and the smoked duck breast to die for. Highly recommend the charcuterie and cheese plate as well. The menu and the wine list are a touch limited at lunch, but the selections were excellent and the service was impeccable."
133,"My new favorite restaurant in NYC! Had lunch here with our friends the first day of our visit and it couldn't have been a better experience. Food was wonderful - Nicoise salad with seared tuna, Croque Madame sandwich, onion soup (best ever). Atmosphere was very special - we were seated at a table window overlooking the intersection of the quaint Christopher and Gay streets. Service was perfect - knowledgable, friendly and accessible. Will definitely be back next time we visit New York."
134,Would love to give more stars!! Found this quaint place via Trip Advisor and I honestly can’t recommend it high enough!! Quaint intimate atmosphere that is totally not pretentious! Our wAiter Ballal was attentive but not hovering and serves a mean cocktail! Highly recommend escargot and mussels! Everything was delicious and modestly priced! Loved!!❤️
135,"Fantastic French dining in Greenwich Village! Small place, but cozy and warm. Excellent service and killer Martinis! Wifey had the Duck a L'Orange and it was excellent. My rack of Lamb was to die for. This place is not cheap, but well worth the little extra cost. Looking forward to trying their other location as well."
136,"We flew to NYC to celebrate a friends birthday. I found this resturant on TripAdvisor and contacted them to make arrangements for our friends ""birthday dinner"". To keep the story short - let's just say: We had--a great French meal -- in a great location -- with great service. I am 100% sure that when we travel to NYC again we will be making reservations to eat here again."
137,"Great food, great atmosphere, friendly professional service, it was like escaping to Paris for a few hours without leaving NYC. My wife and I dined here on a recent Sunday to celebrate my birthday and what a pleasure. The menu is relatively brief but contains enough breadth to satisfy diners of all types, and naturally the focus is on traditional bistro fare. After starting with salade verde we had steak frites and beef bourginon. Desserts were creme brûlée and apple tarte tartin. All of the food was delicious, very attractively plated and professionally presented. Prices are fair, especially given the quality and the portions. There is also a nice wine list with a good choice of fairly priced wines by the glass and bottle. The setting is quintessential bistro, an attractive bar and tables and chairs, as the name implies it is rather small but delivers at a very high level. It is no surprise that it is a multiple Certificate of Excellence winner, they strive to make you feel welcome and deliver a terrific experience. This was our first visit but will not be our last."
138,"I found myself in this delightful restaurant on a friend’s recommendation. First off, the setting is like stepping into a European restaurant, the decor is simple and stylish and the crowd hip but unpretentious. I ordered the mussels and frites and they were delicious. The service by Mickael was superb, he was so friendly and attentive and made some excellent recommendations. I can’t say enough good things about this restaurant, perfect location and ambiance, wonderful friendly service and great food. If you find yourself in the west village I highly recommend this hidden gem."
139,"Beautiful place in New York. We loved the food, the Tatin was fabulous ! Great service too ! I recommend this place"
140,"I really enjoyed our dinner. Very good service, and very good food. The sitting is fairly tight. Seemed to be a popular local restaurant. Lively atmosphere and very good waiter - sorry, I lost his name."
141,"nice cozy restaurant, great service and great food. Had the Chateaubriand, great! For dessert Tarte Tatin mmmmmmmm!!!"
142,"One of the best values I have ever had in NYC. Delicious pate and salads for starters, Two of my friends had the lamb dish. It was cooked perfectly and was really flavorful. Nice vegetables on the side. Not a big portion of lamb, but just right when you are having another course or two. I would go back once a week for the linguini with shrimp and crab. Don't let the squid ink scare you off. My friend had the steak frites which was ridiculously tender and tasty.  Excellent waiter who gave us good advice on wine and even gave us an extra scoop of pistachio gelato to share. Reasonable prices. This was my favorite meal of the trip."
143,Small French restaurant- chic and intimate. Excellent quality food. Rather noisy and lively lunchtime service. Chefs selection of different charcuterie and cheese-$28 was good value. However wine at eye watering prices ! -$52 for a bottle of Sauvignin blanc was the cheapest white wine selection !
144,"The location is really cute and cozy. Unfortunately also loud because of the huge windows, the stone floor and the high rooms. The service is super friendly and fast. The food is okay from the price, a main course costs about 35 dollars. Unfortunately, the food of four of us was cold and there was no side dish like potatoes or pasta to the main courses."
145,"Small very left bank bistro with extremely tasty food. Tables are cramped and noise level significant with people talking louder and louder to be heard by their dinner companion. Loud, jarring overhead music adds to the din. Clearly this atmosphere works for a lot of people but from a “romantic” standpoint, forewarned is forearmed."
146,Michael and Sofie were a delight. Michael runs the floor with magic and a light foot. Sofie is exactly the right amount of Parisian Bon Vivant and flick of the hair.  The food is fabulous and you must try the beef Bourguignon will make Balthazar’s blush.  One for a fun evening in the west village by candlelight and then enjoy the people and the surrounding heritage of Christopher street!
147,"When here for the first time for our anniversary. we were warmly greeted adn treated to a glass of sparkling wine. We enjoyed a delicious dinner of rack of lamb and grilled salmon, perfectly prepared. Preceded by escargot and accompanied by lovely rench wine by the glass. Our server Michael was delightful and took the time to share with the many interesting facts about the restaurant and life in NYC. We'll be back"
148,We had a very nice brunch here. Nice French atmosphere with good service and friendly and attentive staff
149,"Really friendly service, relaxed atmosphere, and good quality food at this charming neighbourhood restaurant. A great place for a slow lunch and some people watching over a couple of glasses of wine."
150,We ate one night at the larger Boucherie and loved it - so we thought we'd try their sister restaurant - it was also very good - totally different - the large restaurant is lively and loud - this was small and intimate
151,Loved the ambience of this charming small French restaurant. Reasonable prices. Sauce on the filet was perfect. Cocktails delicious. Staff very nice and helpful with menu. Excellent service. Didn’t hover. Great timing. If we lived in that neighbor we’d be there every night.
152,"Hey, after a while it's really hard to get excited about a restaurant once you've eaten at a lot of them over the years. But this place makes a great exception! It is well worth the price tag for some authentic Parisian style dishes. The place has a small bar and tables along a fairly good stretch of walls with windows. We ordered an entrée split for 4 people as an appetizer ""Moules Frites"" ($27.00) and it disappeared within minutes - delicious sauce! Our mains consisted of (2) Branzino dishes ($32.00ea)which I could not get over how deliciously they were prepared - sophisticated and delicate spices and a texture that I have never experienced before! An absolute winner! Also, ordered 1 Chateaubriand ($31.00) which is a rarity as I have never seen a Chateaubriand plated for just 1 person and deliciously tender. We also had the Canard l'Orange ($32.00 duck) which was spectacular! We followed up with coffees all-around and the Mousse Au Chocolat ($12.00) everything else came from the bar and wine racks. When we made reservations a few days before we had asked for their best table and we got it. Our server Dinah was simply the best - always attentive and quick to respond. Everyone agreed, we had an absolutely memorable time at Petite Boucherie in the West Village! The expense (and they are up their in prices) is totally forgotten because of the excellence of the experience."
153,Amazing romantic place ! We were like in Paris. Service and food are incredible ! We had the best mussels in town ! Cocktails are really originals. Good prices too. We ok be back
154,Amazing food and ambiance! Loved it ! We ll be back! Amazing service. Beautiful restaurant! The lamb and scallops were stunning!
155,"This restaurant is in a lovely spot. It's quite small but feels authentically French. All the staff were excellent and friendly. We loved our mussels in white wine and had gorgeous desserts of chocolate mousse and tarte tatin. Wine and cocktails were good although typically expensive for NYC. We were kept topped up constantly with tap water. Cost around $200 dollars (not including tips) for bread, three mains, three desserts and a drink each. We really enjoyed our meal here. We booked, which I'd recommend, as it was very busy."
156,"This is my idea of a great restaurant. Fairly small, it is cosy, great service (the man who served us was excellent), great food (best streak frites I have ever had I think) and great wine. We went back a couple of times just for a mid-day glass of wine.  The area it is situated in is also interesting - close to West Village and Greenwich village. We go to New York every year and have added this to our (small) best restaurant list.  The only slight downside was breakfast. After such a great dinner, we had booked breakfast. The night before we got an odd text stating that they had changed the reservation to the day after our booking on our instructions - we had not given any such instruction and texted back to say so. When we turned up at the booked time they told us that they were doing some work to the lights and pointed us to their sister restaurants. As we had come all the way across town to get there, it would have been nice if they had actually told us they were not open for the time we had booked. It was equivalent to us not turning up for a confirmed reservation without telling them, which I know they (rightly) take a dim view off.  Will assume this was a one off and will be back to this excellent restaurant."
157,"We were walking around Greenwich and my son was very hungry so stopped there for lunch. Ordered croque monsieur, pâtes au fruits de mer, salade niçoise and finished with crème brûlée. It’s like having lunch in Paris! The bread for the croque monsieur was very crunchy and the dark pasta with the squid ink was delicious!"
158,"a lovely local spot with good food, friendly staff and moderate prices. the lunch was perfect for my sister and me. we will be back again and again."
159,"I was travelling with my familly in NYC, last day, happy but tired, looking for a place close to our apartment. We found the restaurant a bit randomly in the village. Being of french descent we are often suspicious about french restaurant abroad.  This was a very good surprise. Nice place, very good and original food mixing US and french influences. Best night of the week. Thanks very much !"
160,"Real French food, service and ambience in Greenwich. Amazing Mousse de Foue Agra’s, Moules Frutes and Creme Brûlée. Small 28 cover restaurant. Unpretentious French bistro vibe. Loved it. Definitely coming back!"
161,"Wine selection was excellent. We had a very pleasant rose, that went well with most of our choices, that range from meat to vegetarian. Friendly service, the bistro is small enough to make you feel right at home. All the dishes were well prepared and large enough to feel happy about both quality and quantity."
162,"We really had a great time here, The staff were awesome and the place was really comfortable. Will definitely be coming back"
163,"Good experience, we enjoyed food and wine selection. The place itself was cozy and comfortable. We felt relaxed and fresh."
164,"absolutely delightful experience. Amazing food and service. The wait staff have great knowledge of the food beogn prepared. If you haven't experienced this kind of dining before I would highly recommend it my favorite Auckland restaurant. The new chef is even better. The wine pairing is bang on and the sommelier suggestions are fantastic. The staff is wonderful - professional, fun, friendly, warm, helpful and attentive."
165,"Small, loud and tightly seated restaurant - things that I normally don't enjoy and tolerate - but here. This restaurant I love ! Great neighbourhood in Greenwich - enjoy the traditional fare. Great service, food and the place will bring a smile. Rates high on the romantic scale. See you there next time !"
166,I booked this restaurant based on Trip Advisor reviews and wasn't disappointed. I also booked well in advance as it's close to The Stonewall Inn on the corner of Gay St & Christopher St and I was visiting during World/NPC Pride...as such the atmosphere was great and the restaurant full. The food was beautiful - I had specials for Starter and Main including Confit Duck. Friends also advised their food was lovely and they did a killer 'Old Fashioned' Cocktail....which arrived with a nod to Pride. Service Great - friendly and paced well. I'd definately go again.
167,An inviting little corner restaurant with simple but delicious French food run by a friendly team. The seared scallops are particularly good. Large windows make Petite Boucherie the perfect place to sit with a glass of wine and watch the Village streets.
168,"Petite Boucherie's corner location with big windows and views onto the quiet side streets really give it a warm and welcoming bistro feel. But it's the food that made it a great restaurant for us. We both really enjoyed the mains we chose, which felt lovingly and carefully cooked. We then shared a very nice tarte tatin with ice cream for dessert. We were there in the evening and the atmosphere was casual, calm and candlelit. In what can be a very loud, animated city our evening at Petite Boucherie was instead relaxed and calming due to the friendly, helpful service along with the great food that was beautifully prepared. Would definitely recommend."
169,"Excellent service, creative menu, authentic charm and cuisine! Our favorite restaurant in the Village and best meal in NYC. Octopus is not to be missed. Highly recommend! Fantastic cocktails too."
170,"My mother and I had a lovely time at this charming restaurant. It was very cosy and authentic, and with a great burger and creme brulee, and friendly staff. Highly recommended!"
171,"I am a fan of Boucherie, visited both Boucherie locations, and had great experience and amazing food from both places. When they added another location named Petite Boucherie, we were more than excited to go try this location. As the name of the restaurant implied, the inside was quite small. Very cozy and welcoming atmosphere.  For appetizer, we had Camembert Roti and Soupe À L’oignon Au Fromage. Now, ask yourself, do you love cheese? Do you dream about bathing in a melty, velvety, rich pool of hot cheese? Then Camembert Roti might be your soulmate. Cheese lovers’ dream! So amazing, high quality, and just melt your heart… French onion soup was a thing of beautify, with the golden cheese on top, holding in all the liquid goodness down below.  For main, we had Wagyu Truffle Burger and Steak Frites Beurre Maître d’hôtel. The burger was much bigger than I expected, and it looked so wonderful…These amazing burgers are the reason why I could never stop my love and obsession for burgers… I totally LOVED it!!! The steak was really nice too, almost crunchy and crispy on the outside, cooked a bit more than med rare that we requested, which was a bit sad… But, it was still tasty.  For dessert, we had Crème Brûlée. It was very creamy and velvety, classic done right!  We had a wonderful dinner, Boucherie never disappoint! Our server, Sophie was super friendly and helpful, took a great care of us. She was so lovely! The manager Michael was really nice too, we enjoyed talking to him. We felt totally welcomed. It was a really relaxing dinner with delicious food, love to return again for more!"
172,The staff and dining experience were superb! The restaurant is intimate and the food is delicious. Make a reservation - it's fabulous
173,Had a wonderful late lunch before heading back home two hours away. I a pasta dish while hubby had a seafood dish. Exquisite everything.
174,Service was both excellent and friendly. The boeuf bourguignon was the best I have ever eaten. Great atmosphere and the wine was good.We will definitely be going back.
175,"We were smitten by Michael and the restaurant the moment we walked in. He was welcoming, charming and helped make the evening even more fabulous. Great atmosphere. Delicious food."
176,"Food, wine, atmosphere.. everything is great and one of the best French restaurant I’ve done in a while !"
177,"charming from the outside, cute brasserie with a French atmosphere but clearly lacks warmth in the greetings. The food is average at best. Had the snails and were borderline “insipid”. best to avoid if you are French and do not want to be disappointed."
178,"We recently had dinner here, enjoying the service and atmosphere -- both were wonderful. We ordered the moules aux frites and the pappardelle as entrees and both were delicious. Oddly, however, the pappardelle entree was quite small -- and I'm a small woman -- it just looked like a side dish rather than a main course. For that reason, I'm giving the restaurant 4 stars -- otherwise, everything was very good and I would recommend it."
179,"The food was pretty good especially the escargots and the carré d'agneau, but I had the Saint Jacques Provencal for main course. Well, the sea scallops were ordinary, but the promised provencal sauce turned out to be tomato paste fresh out of the can. Oh, the chocolate mousse was excellent, but the scallops with tomato paste were disappointing. Also, there was a middle age gentleman having dinner at the bar who seemed to be the manager, but all he was doing was enjoying his meal."
180,"This is the most perfect French restaurant I have ever been in....including those visited in France! The menu is exquisite....try the lamb chops. Bar is excellent, they serve a great Old Fashioned. Wonderful evening."
181,"Wandered in here for a late lunch after exploring the neighborhood, and was charmed by the atmosphere, the food, the staff. Sonia B., our server, was delightful. Recommend the moules frites although we all very much enjoyed what we ordered. If I were lived nearby I'd be a regular."
182,"Great service, excellent food, great value for the neighborhood. We had mussels and frites, steak and frites, steak tartare, and a burger, all terrific. Highly recommend."
183,"This restaurant has only been open for a couple of years and has built up a loyal clientele in that time. A cozy warm atmosphere is generated in this small corner building with large windows, and there is also a basement bar area which looked worthy of a revisit. The menu is fairly simple with some classic French dishes. We were there for dinner and I had the beef chateaubriand - cooked perfectly as requested. Great wine selection, and the staff are really attentive. Will definitely go back to this place."
184,"Went there for dinner with the family. ALL the dishes we had were great. The service was great. The place is small, but that was not an issue. Highly recommend!"
185,"Love, love this place. Charming, delicious and fabulous. Drink and dine at the bar for the perfect NYC evening. xx"
186,"Excellent food, exceptional service, great ambiance. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone Guy and Carol from Moncton, New Brunswick"
187,We have been here several times and it's consistently delicious. Service with a friendly smile. We will be back again and again.
188,"Absolutely gorgeous spot for dinner - staff are super friendly (yet still highly professional), the food is superb and the atmosphere is cosy - perfect for an intimate romantic dinner for two, or a small group. (I just wish the standard of all food in New York was half as good as that at Petite Boucherie!).  I highly recommend a visit to Petite Boucherie."
189,"Friendly from the entrance, fab French wine. ‘Cote du Rhône’ stunning simple steak tartare, as it should be. Sublime beef bourguignon. And lovely French waitress. And the peach view"
190,"Lovely dinner, I had the beef chateaubriand - cooked perfectly as requested. The service and attention to detail was faultless also. A wonderful night had by all."
191,Great food and great staff too. We tried few dishes from the menu and they all tasted perfect. We’ll be back for sure!
192,"An amazing place with awesome food, great ambiance, talented stuff and cool bartender. Everything we tried was great - appetizers, main course and desert. Cocktails by Yas were out of this world, thank you very much, my friend. Highly recommend this great restaurant."
193,"So amazing! I love the food and the atmosphere and the wait staff, everything about this place is amazing!!"
194,"This is our 3rd dinner at this restaurant and it continues to deliver a wonderful experience and 5 star food. The waiter was very friendly and attentive without constantly interrupting our conversation. We had the French Onion soup, salmon, and chateaubriand. All were nicely presented and very tasty. The chocolate mouse and creme brule were also fantastic. The seating is a little tight and noise level a bit loud, but not significant enough to affect the overall experience.  We will definitely return for another wonderful meal the next time we travel to NYC."
195,"New to the neighborhood, dropped in later on a Sunday night. Warm ambience and wonderful service. Food is excellent - delicious salmon and tarte tatin for dessert, my husband really enjoyed his chateaubriand!"
196,Cute little bistro - great space for friends or romantic date to enjoy food French food. Has steak tartare and escargot!
197,Cute little spot in for a birthday or date night. Such a cozy atmosphere and great food! the bartenders are really friendly :)
198,My friends and I had a great time at Petit Boucherie in the West Village. The restaurant is so beautiful with gorgeous roses around the door situated on a quaint corner. The food was delicious and the wine amazing. The atmosphere was intimate and perfect for a night out.
199,"Great wine, really cute date spot. Highly recommend. Really good French restaurant. Make reservations!"
200,"We’re not wealthy and the idea of spending a hundred and fifty dollars to eat meh food and rude snooty waiters was not appealing! However I wasn’t in the mood for the same old thing, and the hope of really good French bistro was worth the risk! Well, what can I say! The food was splendid, the staff pleasant and accommodating and the atmosphere austere yet elegant in its simplicity and unpresumptuousness! Truly a gem!"
201,Best French restaurant in NYC. Romantic and cozy atmosphere. Great service they were very attentive and food was served quickly. Everything was delicious.
202,Spent an amazing moment at petite boucherie. Loved this typical french bistro. Food and service was perfect Will definitely go back
203,Lovely atmosphere for a dinner for two ;) french quisine like in Paris <3 Friendly service with the right french touch.
204,"Food was great, tasty, traditional French, portions were a good size. Restaurant had a lovely French cafe style, and a friendly feel, service was very good."
205,"Great selection of Absinthe cocktails, mixed with a loverly perisian cafe atmosphere make the Petite Boucherie one of my favourite eats in New York. Really tasty food and lovely staff to boot."
206,"I was here on a Saturday night with a friend, had a couple of drinks and something to eat at the bar. Good cocktails, good food, great people... what’s not to like ?"
207,"Very very good. And food is French, trust me I m French . 😁 Enjoy the boeuf bourguigon and the chateau brilliant."
208,"Visited Petite Boucherie on my own on a snowy rainy day on a Tuesday. The bad weather was probably why I could sit down immediately at 8pm. Restaurant was 75% full. I guess on a day with normal weather you would really need a reservation or sit and eat at the bar. A good selection of wines by the glas (a little pricy, but hey we are in New York). The Chateaubriand I ordered was a good size portion, perfectly cooked and I need to mention the delicious gravy. Nice French café style restaurant, good service with fast and very helpfull staff. I'll definitely will come back on my next trip to NY."
209,Service was outstanding. Every need was taken care of It was restaurant week and the specials were to die for. The sauces were superior and the fish was really fresh.
210,"Excellent cute little French bistro! The service was impeccable, we got seated within 5 minutes of our reservation. The food is typically French and cooked with high quality ingredients. I had the mushroom and truffle raviolis and my husband the filet mignon and we were both very happy with our choices. The chocolate mousse was a nice nice and not too sweet or heavy. Highly recommend it for a date!"
211,"After dining at Petite Boucherie this past Monday evening, it has topped my list for favorite restaurants in NY. The neighborhood is quaint, the ambiance in the restaurant is great, the service fantastic and the food was wonderful. It was the fist time in recent memory I was able to walk out of a restaurant without the ability to criticize anything. It was an awesome dining experience! I can't wait for my next visit to NY to dine here again!"
212,"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful breakfast here. The food was fresh, and very nicely presented. Fabulous service. I loved the quiet romantic ambiance of the restaurant and people watching out the large windows."
213,Perfect little French bistro were everyone loved their dish which ranged from salad to salmon to duck.
214,Just amazing !!! I am french girl and so happy to remind me so excellent subtle french food thanks to this restaurant ! All was at the top !!! Bon juste génial vraiment !!! Bel avenir à petite boucherie ! C'est hummmmmmm !!!!!!!!
215,Amazing French restaurant in the heart of west village. Food was amazing and typically French. Great wine selection . Staff is really attentive. Will definitely go back to this place.
216,"We were looking for a French place for breakfast and found this on TripAdvisor. It’s nestled in one of the cozy corners on Christopher Street. We tried the Waffle with berries, Duck Hash & Salmon. All of them were good. Would definitely like to try their bigger and better version- La Boucherie next time."
217,"Delicious meals, friendly crew (they even speak french!) & very gorgeous restaurant. Would recommend to go there for a date. It's perfectly cute!"
218,La petite boucherie is a really good place to eat French food in a really nice area ! The menu is made according to the season and the Tarte Tatin is just a Poem !!!
219,"Excellent food, wine and services. It’s a tight little place but very cozy. Staffs are friendly and very accommodating! We enjoyed it very much!"
220,"We felt like we were transported to France. The atmosphere is cozy and perfect and it is run by Frenchmen. Everyone has a french accent. We started with the frogs' legs- delicious! For entrees, we had the duck which was very french and fabulous. The owner and wait staff were so polite and personable. We can't wait to go back."
221,"This place has sweet atmosphere and the neighborhood is fun. It’s a good option if you’re seeking absinthe cocktails. But the French fare as just average. We had canard a la orange, chateaubriand, onion soup and a salad, creme brûlée. I was disappointed. Maybe a different chef than produced such an otherwise high rating?"
222,This small place has an amazing atmosphere of energy and yet intimacy. The food was incredibly delicious! We will return!!!
223,"Great food. We had the onion soup, the artichoke salad, the burger, the scallops, and the creme brûlée. Everything was delicious. Service was excellent, too. Only complaint was our table was right next to the bar. We had a reservation and the place was fairly empty when we got there. Walk ins were given better tables. But a minor complaint."
224,"The place is small and cute. It looks nice and has a nice vibe. The onion soup was delicious. The cheese was melty gooey, but could have been a little browned. The escargot needed more flavor/garlic. Both entrees were delicious, but both needed better/more tasty sauces; they were a disappointment. No nice crispy French bread and a good butter. The chocolate mousse was excellent, as was the service. All in all a disappointment."
225,Excellent meal! Staff were attentive and helpful without being intrusive. Atmosphere was intimate and welcoming. Food was great too! Book with confidence!
226,"We have just finished our meal and it was fantastic! Mickael (our server) was incredible. We had the French onion soup, truffle ravioli and the beef short rib. Simple out of this world!"
