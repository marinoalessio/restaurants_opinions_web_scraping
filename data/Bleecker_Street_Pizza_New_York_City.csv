42,Best pizza we have ever had . Pepperoni and Nona Maria . Both gorgeous and good price too . Still felt like and proper New York pizza place . Nice to be able to sit in too
43,"Amazing pizza, great tasting and very ‘New York’. Just exactly what you’d expect, no frills, great price. Really recommend."
44,"This is a must! great pie great vibe, we had gone to the fat cat for the evening and needed something good. Bleecker was it and hit the spot"
45,We stopped by here for an early lunch. The pizza was amazing. We enjoyed sitting with Greg and chatting while he shared stories of NYC and the pizza!
46,Popped in here whilst touring the city. Very warm welcome by Gregg whose happy to stop for a chat with his customers! Most importantly the pizza here was absolutely delicious would def recommend this place.... Hello Greg & happy new year to you from Deb & Steve from Bristol England
47,Incredible spot in NY with fantastic pizza. Cheese and Mushrooms the best ones. Great atmosphere and fast attention. Very recommendable
48,The pizza was excellent. So many delicious flavors and options. Greg was fantastic and made our trip worthwhile!! A must-see in New York City.
49,"This was our first experience in NYC. You'd better know what you want, as there is impatience for holding up the process by asking questions. The pizza was ok. It was not worth a special trip. The crust and sauce were just mediocre in our opinion. We got there during a brief lull, but it got packed very quickly on a Sunday early afternoon. We did notice that John's of Bleeker Street had quite the line waiting to get in for their pizza...had when spent more time in that area, we may have tried that one."
50,"OK, so we wanted to go to the others but queuing in the cold wasn't an option, so to find Bleecker Street Pizza was a bonus. Really enjoyed all the slices we had and the staff were helpful and friendly"
51,"Was here with my wife. Brilliant pizza, brilliant Greg! A must stop for everyone who likes pizza! Ordered the one they are famous for, don’t remember what it’s called, bit it eas really nice. They also had a good plain pizza with cheese. We might just pop by again!"
52,"Our family is vacationing over the Christmas holidays and wanted authentic NYC pizza. We had been to Bleeker Street pizza last year for a slice but this year we wanted to try the famous Nona Maria! This did not disappoint! The crust was thin and crispy, the cheese was fresh! Amazing! We highly recommend this restaurant. If you get a chance to meet Greg, he’s delightful. We enjoyed his sharing of memories about his brother and his colleagues who experienced 911 and are not forgotten!"
53,"This pizza is the real deal! Super crunchy and thin with a touch of char. Go on Friday and meet Greg, the owner."
54,"Crazy atmosphere, lots of folks buzzing around & eating the best pizza you can imagine. Its a pizza joint in the west village and all the culture that goes with that....beautiful & delightful."
55,"Would highly recommend a pop into bleaker pizza everything was great. We had chipotle chicken, pepperoni for the kids and Canadian bacon. loved them all."
56,"Maybe I'm spiled with the quality of the pizza I get elsewhere, but I don't understand the hype this place gets. The pizza was pretty good, but nothing special. And certainly nothing to wait an hour for."
57,"This pizza lives up to the hype. If you find yourself in the Village, this place is a must. Get a couple of slices of the Nonna Maria. The restaurant is small and seating is limited so you might have to wait. It will be worth it though."
58,Pizza was AMAZING - Nonna Maria!!! Great to see Greg again! He gave my daughter a pen 1st visit this time a post card! Yes she still has the pen!
59,Heard good things about this place before coming to NYC. The nonna Maria slice lived up to the expectation. Best pizza slice ever.
60,"We went to this place after our breakfast to try out the iconic Nonna Maria pizza slice. I think I can state that it is an ordinary pizza slice, however, the vibe of eating a pizza slice in NYC make that slice the best you have ever had."
61,Of all the pizza places that we tried and our trip to New York City this was the best pizza by far! The pepperoni bacon and I believe it was a sicilian pepperoni had so much cheese I can barely finish. Highly recommend
62,Great pizza and good range of flavour/topping choices on offer although we did just opt for cheese! Sat outside on a lovely sunny November day.
63,"Gary was even better than the pizza, if that is even possible. He took the time to visit with us and tell our group all about the story that makes their pizza the best. My first bite was almost transcendent as the flavors hit my mouth. The BEST pizza ever!!!"
64,"We’d seen a review of the pizza on YouTube and really wanted to try it. Having didn’t the morning around the Battery Park area, we walked back towards Times Square and stopped here for food. The pizza was delicious! All four of us raved about our choices - which never happens!"
65,"Located on a busy corner it looks like one of many New York pizza joints - but walk in and you see why it is special. We were fortunate that the owner, Greg, was there to great you. His first question of all his guests is “where you from?” He serves the perfect fold-it NY pizza, in a minute, and with Greg’s whit and charm.  Don’t miss out - go and get a Bleecker St Pizza!"
66,I'm a pizza lover .I am an expert in pizza and if you are like me go to this pizzeria immediately. You will be surprised how good they are.
67,"One of, if not the best NYC experience!  Greg and the staff were fantastic, telling us stories and asking about myself and my partner while we waited.  Pizza is the best I've ever eaten! I can't wait to go back.  Everything that's great about NYC wrapped up into one place.  Thank you!  Jack & Nikita, York."
68,"We visited on 4th November, this was on the list of places to go and so glad that we did. We were a party of 6 and everybody loved this place.  Greg was a great host, he is a real character and make sure you get the chance to speak with him. If i am ever back in NY I will be going back. It's situated in Greenwich Village too so well worth the visit.  Pizza made fresh infant of us, cooked perfectly and the cheese was awesome. Thank you"
69,"Bleaker Street Pizza is the epitome of New York pizza. Our family tried a variety of the pizzas and all were amazing. While there we had the pleasure of meeting a previous owner, Greg who made the experience even better. He was so friendly and a fountain of knowledge of things to do in the area. Highly recommend you stop in and give this place a try."
70,"My husband and I are traveling to New York for an anniversary trip and wanted to make sure we got some pizza while we were here. Bleecker Street Pizza kept coming up on our searches of top places to go and it did not disappoint!! We tried a variety of slices and they’re were all delicious! Highly recommend.  As tourist, my husband was taking a look at the photo wall of all the celebrities that had visited and Greg came over to talk to us. He gave us the history of the place and a post card from the restaurant for our anniversary. He was so nice and friendly and made the experience 10X better!!"
71,"We were visiting NYC for the first time in years and had to get pizza. Bleeker Sttert did not disappoint. Although they had several options, I always use the plain cheese pizza as a means of comparison and the sauce crust and cheese were perfect."
72,This is not my favorite NYC pizza by a long shot. Sorry. I used to say Joe’s takes the crown but now there are so many formidable spots…
73,"Bought two nonna maria slices. Topping flavours were good but the base was the soggiest, limpest excuse for a base I ever tasted. Very disappointed after having heard such great recommendations. Maybe they were just having a bad day."
74,"We had a slice of pizza as part of the ""free tours by foot"" tour. Greg, the owner, was super nice and friendly and answered all our questions about pizza, the history of the pizzeria and anything else we asked him. But more importantly - the pizza (something with ""nonna') was one of the best. The crust was super crispy, just the right amount of cheese and the sauce was delish. Glad we discovered this place!"
75,"Ordered the cheese, pepperoni and Nonna Maria pizza. The pizza tasted fantastic and the crust was crispy with just the right thickness. The nonna Maria was the best. Greg was really friendly and a great photographer."
76,Quite dry and crispy pizza. Maybe because we bought slices which are reheated and so baked twice. Good selection of toppings available and quite inexpensive.
77,"I mean it was really good. I really liked the crust and the fact that there was a place to sit. After eating 4 different famous new york pizzas on the same day, I would say I enjoyed it, but it wasn't my favourite of the bunch"
78,"Have been here dozens of times when in the area. In a city full of many many pizza places, this is probably the best. Get there early!"
79,"I was recommended this place by a friend and YouTube personality as one of the best pizza places in New York, and it certainly blew my mind! Got the pepperoni and sausage slice. Crust is very thin, but sturdy and crispy. All the toppings were very fresh and flavorful. Perfect balance of cheese and tomato. Having tried this and Joe's in NY, I'll probably won't be eating pizza back home anytime in the next 3 months!!"
80,"When we walked in we were looking up at the menu, totally unsure what to order, thankfully Greg walked up and recommended the Nonna Maria Pizza (followed by 2 random customers also recommending it as well) it was AMAZING! Best pizza I've ever had, Greg stopped by our table to make sure we liked it and shared some extremely interesting history of the restaurant (and took our picture for us). So glad we went out of our way to make this part of our New York experience!"
81,"Decided to go on a long walk from Times Square down 7th avenue (past Perry Street) for those Sex in the City fans, and ended up here as a reward for those miles! Excellent place, quite busy, really fast service, alcohol and soft drinks, cafe set up, pizza slices fresh as always people coming in due to its high rating, good choice, and one of the best value for money food I’ve had in New York, worth a visit"
82,"We were told that we had to go to Bleecker Street Pizza. We did. And with high expectations. And those expectations were exceeded. The pizza is just wonderful. Best my wife and I have ever had. Also ... Greg, part of the founding family, was very very welcoming - and engaging. We went back 2 days later for another pizza. David & Susan from San Francisco"
83,"We came to the neighbourhood specifically to try the pizza here and it was very good value at just $4 a slice. The highlight however was Greg who worked there; he talked to my wife and I about the pizza, the area and made us feel super welcomed. We will return just to see Greg again!"
84,"Before going to NY, I looked at the top recommended pizza establishments, and wow this pizza place did not disappoint. I ordered their speciality the noma and it was amazing, perfect crunch on the crust and then a beautiful inside. I will absolutely return"
85,"I had watched several NYC Pizza videos before travelling to NYC and lots of them mentioned Bleeker Street so I knew I had to come here. I tried a slice of pepperoni pizza, sauce was amazing and the crust was also excellent. Also, Greg noticed my accent and had a conversation with me which was nice and he gave me a postcard aswell."
86,"Today was our second visit to this amazing pizza place. The pizza is delicious: the Nonna Maria is as good as advertised and the buffalo chicken is fantastic.  We were lucky enough to meet Greg today too - hi Greg! - with whom we had a lovely chat as he told us a bit about himself and the background to BSP.  This place is a long way from home for us - North Yorkshire - but if we could, we'd be very regular, loyal customers.  We might even go back a third time before we fly home..."
87,This pizza is some of the best in NYC. The flavors were so tasty and you can easily tell the quality of the ingredients. The buff chicken was my favorite but the pepperoni was top notch also. The staff was great and despite the long line everyone got through very quickly!
88,"Often described as the best pizza in NY, is it? I don’t know, I certainly haven’t tried them all happy to keep trying others but didn’t find any we preferred. Lots of choice but having had a taster of the Nonna Maria on our food tour, had to try it again for a full slice. Lovely crispy base but really light and tasty dough and sauce. It’s a busy and cozy place but that just adds to the atmosphere which is very NY. You’ve got to give it a whirl."
89,"The Nonna Maria pizza was amazing! The crust was crispy and soft at the same time and the ingredients were fresh and delicious. We were welcomed by Greg, who was extremely nice and found some time to chat with us about our home country :) Greetings from Poland. If we are back in NYC, we will definitely visit Bleecker Street Pizza again!"
90,"Pizza was served well, delicious and well packaged, i love the outside seating, can wait to have my lunch here again."
91,"We had a fantastic lunch here last week. Recommend by friends we were not disappointed. Greg welcomed us immediately and advised what was best to order. He was so friendly and charming. The pizza was delicious, quick and such great value we would say to anyone to visit for a real treat . Thank you for your hospitality!!"
92,Delicious pizza. Had the pepperoni pizza. The crust is so good. There is outside and inside seating. A restroom is the plus! The restaurant has been voted best pizza three years in a row (I think). It is really good!
93,We arrived at 11:15 to enter and it worked out perfectly. Great pizza and atmosphere! My teen also enjoyed that TS Cornelia St is right around the corner.. would highly recommend!
94,This place is great .. Greg is the owner and he is the best ! Try to talk to him if he’s around he will tell u stories about his brother( nyc police officer and keeper of the family recipes RIP) . He will also steer u right about the best pizza around .. nanos . We had a lot of great pizza in nyc area when we were there but his was the best and his garlic knots are perfect . Family owned and only one location it’s hard to beat .
95,"Pizza was amazing. Great environment, pizza was fabulous. Gregg was super friendly. We will definitely return next time we are in NY."
96,"We decided to visit here after seeing so many people raving about it as the best pizza in New York. Yes it is good but the best? No, we had better whilst staying in New York and probably wouldn’t make the journey out to it if visiting again."
97,Thank you for making our day start with delicious pizza and a nice chat with the kind Greg! Great time!
98,"The Nonna Maria at Bleecker St Pizza is simply the best slice of pizza you’ll ever have. Crispy but light, with an amazing sauce. Even better, Greg the owner is super friendly and always up for a chat to see where people are visiting from, etc.  A proper New York institution, this was our second time there and I’ll be there every single time I get to NYC."
99,"We just visited the place today, it was our first stop, since we just arrived from Lisbon.  Cannot recommend this place enough - the pizza is great!  I also want to give a shout out to Greg, who’s a great story teller and gave us some tips for our nyc trip."
100,This is a kind of pizza you eating at 2 am completely drunk so you don’t know it is that bad. Service is fast and efficient..
101,"We have been here twice, at lunch and at dinner time. If you want to grab a classic New York style pizza, this is the place where to go: crunchy dough and a lot of juicy cheese. The guys at counter are kind and fast and Greg is a great host."
102,"never before have I had such delicious pizza..it is worth going to nyc for their pizza alone!:)) a word of warning though - after Bleecker, all other pizzas will fade into `acceptable` at best;( ;))"
103,Thanks to Greg for making our experience at his restaurant a wonderful one! We visited as part of a food tour and are so glad it was one of our stops. The pizza was delicious and the owner Greg was a great host.
104,Amazing!! Best! Pizza! Ever!! Thanks Greg!! Fast service! Owner is the best. Great location. Super fresh ingredients!!
105,Visited with my husband and two teenage sons whilst we were visiting New York. It took a bit of effort to find but was definitely worth the effort when we did. The pizza was fantastic and was very good value for money. We would happily return and would definitely recommend a visit.
106,"We made the trip to the Village just so we could have a pizza lunch here. The epitome of the New York style pizza, it’s simply the best tasting pizza you will eat. Enough said."
107,The Greeks (Thessaloniki) think that it’s definitely the best pizza in New York and Mr Greg gave useful advices !! (Nona Maria pizza was tha best) ;)
108,Great place to get a New York Slice if you are in the area. I would come back next time I am walking around. Very close to Washington Square Park
109,Came to New York wanting to have good New York style pizza. Found it and I highly recommend it! The staff was great too!! Mr Greg chatted with us a while and was very friendly. I will go back again on future visits.
110,Greg the owner is as charming as he is friendly. Felt really welcomed and the cheese slices are to die for. Definitely recommend making a trip to this local establishments. Can see why they’re the Winner of best pizza in New York 3 years running.
111,Had a very delicious pie with fresh ingredients. This is one of the better places I’ve been to in NYC. I would recommend this place!
112,"Gorgeous pizza, great value, fast service. Enjoyed the food and our visit very much and would recommend to anyone. Salad was fresh and well prepared too."
113,The best pizza in NYC!! We had heard about their famous Nonna Maria pizza before we came and it did not disappoint. So delicious and the tomato sauce is out of this world. A special shout out to Greg for being so lovely and welcoming. Will definitely be returning on our next to trip to the city!
114,"Fabulous pizza, wonderful friendly service. Felt totally at home here, definitely the best pizza in New York."
115,"So having been to NYC a few times and tried the $1 pizza slices before, ahead of this visit I did my research to see which of the pizza places were considered to be the best of the best.  Bleecker Street Pizza was mentioned SO many times!!! People were rating it as the best in NYC and that is not a term I would ever throw around lightly!  Well, today the day came that I got to experience a slice for myself to see if all the hype was true. Anxiously I walked through the front door, as with anything that gets a lot of hype, there is always the worry the reality won’t live up to it.  Thankfully, my worries were unfounded and the slice of pepperoni was delivered hot and delicious. The pepperoni wasn’t a spicy one but it had a slight tickle of which we perfect, the tomato and cheese super fresh and delicate when bitten into. All in all stunning!  Would I profess it is the “Best in NYC” - I’ll leave that up to you. Pizza can be very individual, some people prefer thin and crispy, others deep pan etc."
116,"Best pizza in New York if not the country! An honor to meet Greg and visit with him during our food tour with Claire! We’ve had 2 other slices from 2 “well know “ places in Times Square that didn’t even come close to this pizza!! Crisp crust, gooey cheese, and Grandma’s amazing sauce…you won’t go wrong with a trip to the village to eat here!"
117,Went to Bleecker Street Pizza today. Pizza is awesome and Greg is a wonderful gentleman and host. He took time to show our daughter around and took a great picture with her. We will be back.
118,"We were here for lunch. Pizza was served quickly, hot and sooo good. This had to be one of the best pizza I have ever had. The service was great and the price was more than reasonable."
119,"...but this is simply the best pizza in the US, period. The Nona Maria! My hubby and I dream about it. PERFECTION. So happy it's stayed constant throughout the years."
120,Absolutely life changing pizza! It's going to be hard to enjoy anything else now. The service was top notch and the owner Greg was friendly and welcoming.
121,"Awesome pizza! The pepperoni pizza was the best oh my gosh it was amazing! Good value for money too, you get a lot of pizza, and the drinks are reasonable prices too. And they have beer!"
122,Hands down the best pizza place in NYC. Everytime we visit I have to make my way to Bleecker Street Pizza. The service is always top notch. The Nonna Maria pizza is amazing. Highly recommend
123,"I love pizza. I’ll eat bad delivery pizza, I’ll eat good pizza, I just love it. That being said, I know a great slice when I get it. The Nonna Maria from this place is the best slice I’ve ever had. Will go out of my way to get it next time I’m in NYC."
124,My experience was great I enjoyed every bite. The service was quick and the pizza was freshly made while you wait. I can see why this place is so popular.
125,"I went to Bleeker Street, WAY out of my way as a result of the great reviews. No way this is the best pizza NYC has to offer: Tony & Benny pizza at the airport is better, as is most mall pizza. Very disappointing."
126,Indeed one of the best slices I had. The crust is so crunchy! Even the basic pizza is delicious thanks to the sauce and cheese. Great place.
127,"Bleecker Street Pizza was recommended to us by friends. The food was amazing, but the conversation with Greg made it even better. A wonderful person to chat to and hear about the history of the place. Thanks again for some top notch food! Will be recommending to friends in London and Liverpool!"
128,"We had an amazing time here. Best pizza in NYC. Nonna Maria and Buffalo Chicken pizzas are incresible. Thanks for everything Greg. Kind regards from Budapest, David & Sari"
129,"Pizza was awesome 😎 and Greg’s service was amazing 🤩 I highly recommend this place 😜 , on top of it music was really cool"
130,"Pizza was fantastic and the service, especially from Greg, was exceptional! Thanks Greg! My wife and I were visiting NYC for our 20th wedding anniversary and we decided to eat lunch here and it was really next level. 10/10, would recommend!"
131,"This is a super legit pizza by the slice place in a beautiful neighborhood. The food is amazing as advertised and the people are super friendly. Find Greg, he will make you feel like family!"
132,"we found this place thanks to Youtube and we were not disappointed! the pizza is very good (we had a slice of the Nonna Maria) with a very good crust, special thanks to Greg and his nice welcome !"
133,The pizza was great from toppings to dough . Definitely worth a visit. Service is fast. Lots of tables to sit and enjoy your pizza by the slice or whole.
134,"Very, very good pizza. Some of the best I have had and I have eaten a lot of pizza. Was heaving at lunch time so we knew it would be great. Not too expensive either. We loved chatting to Greg who works there and were made to feel really welcome (we were the English family attending the film festival). Have two friends visiting NYC soon and have made them both promise to visit."
135,We are visiting from South Africa. The Pizza is epic. The owner Greg was there and he made my son and I feel very welcome. He is a great host and a good story teller. If u go to NYC it is a must.  Michael and Harrison.
136,"Coming all the way from Dubai and I always end up here getting a slice of Nonna Maria Pizza. It’s really delicious and I can definitely recommend. I had the honor to meet Greg, a very nice and courteous guy. Keep up the good work."
137,"New Yorkin parhaaksikin väitettyä pizzaa mukavassa kulmakuppilassa. Ja kyllä kannattaa käydä, jos sattuu kulmille. Erinomaisen rapea pohja ja maukas pizza muutenkin. Thank you Greg for your excellent and hearty service! And greetings to your family from us Finns!"
138,"We first visited in 2017 and made a point to visit again. Not only is the service impeccable, but the food and price can’t be beat!!! Be sure to go on a Friday so you can visit with Greg!!!!"
139,We had this place on our NYC 'Bucket list'. We came from near Central park just for this pizza and it lived up to the hype!! Absolutely delicious!!! We had their famous pizza as recommended by Gregg! No other pizza shop compares! Thank you to Gregg and his team for their great hospitality! We look forward to visiting again one day :) x
140,I came to this place by coincidence not knowing that it was definitely going to become the best slices of pizza I had (I tried the nona maria and the white one). It was so fresh and delicious! Greg was really nice to take some photos for me as I was traveling solo and even got me an extra slice for my birthday! I definitely recommend them and would absolutely return when I go back to NY. Great service.
141,We had pizza for breakfast & it was fantastic! This was my favorite pizza we tried while in NYC! The staff were super nice too.
142,Was surprised that they had such friendly service despite being crowded after lunch time. The tastiest slice of pizza I’ve ever had. I was told this was a tourist trap however that could have not been more wrong!!! My husband and I will continue coming on future trips to New York
143,"Loved this place! Greg gave us a great recommendation on what to get, but honestly you can’t go wrong with any of the slices!! 😎"
144,The pizza was 10/10. So many options and tastes delightful. Greg was awesome and made our trip worth it!! Must visit in NYC.
145,We went to Bleecker Street Pizza as part of a West Village Food tour. Greg welcomed us at the entry making us feel very welcomed. He gave us the historical overview of the restaurant and visitors throughout the years and made us feel part of the family. Pizza was delicious and delivered promptly. Highly recommend!
146,"We were first greeted by Greg who somehow knew we were from Ft. Lauderdale Fla...I swear he had a crystal ball. This was our 2nd trip there and was not disappointed. We had the Nonna Maria slice and was as delicious as we remembered the first time. Upon our departure Greg, who only works on Fridays, gave us the history of the the pizzeria. See the photo of the original owner with the NYPD police car on the right wall as you walk in. This is a true NY pizza establishment and you won't be disappointed."
147,"Yummy! Nonna Maria rocks! My teens love it and Greg made it even more awesome! Friendly, kind and yummy food all in one!!!"
148,Great pizza place with very fast service and friendly staff. Prices are good too. A special mention to Gregg who came round the tables and had some great conversation. We will definitely visit again whenever we return to NYC.
149,"Nothing like a fresh, hot slice of pizza. We loved everything we tried and was surprised at the simplicity of some of the pizzas."
150,Best pizza we have ever had in our life!!! We stumbled across this place while walking through New York and it was so good! Great prices the staff were friendly and helpful and we got a beer too!!
151,"With big recommendation from here be barr on YouTube, we went to bleeker Street pizza, the pizza is no joke, awesome. Fresh, we loved it,"
152,"This ""pizza joint"" certainly does not need one more 5 star review....but it was so good that I cannot help heaping on the praises. Some people are just masters of their craft. We had the Nona Maria pizza, the signature pizza, made as an homage to the original brother-owner's grandmother. Using a 6-hour slow cooked marinara, fresh (not low-moisture) mozzarella cheese and fresh basil grown in a greenhouse on a cornmeal dough; the answer to a perfect result, as always, is to start with the best ingredients. The crust is light and perfectly crispy, the toppings simple and tasty. Not much more needs to be said.... tasting it brings the satisfaction that you have completed a visit to the best New York Pizzeria. The bonus was meeting Greg, the owner. He embodies and inspires the ""feel,"" simple and straightforward just like his pizza."
153,"Best pizza in NYC hands down!!! This is such a great small family business to pop in to day or night! The pizza is exactly what I imagined nyc pizza would be! Fresh mozz, amazing marinara, and crunchy crust! Get the Nonna Maria … yum! Classic cheese was amazing as well. Everything tastes so fresh. They have a good drinks selection as well. We can’t wait to go back. My only suggestion would be more outside seating but not much you can do about that lol!"
154,We’ve been in NYC for a week and I’ve been trying to find some pizza that popped with flavor and lived up to the NYC pizza hype. Bleeker was the ticket. As a bonus Greg was working when we visited. He is so friendly and fun to talk to. Thank you Greg for being awesome. We had the Nona and it lived up to its reputation. What I like about NYC pizza is that it doesn’t settle heavy like the Pizza you get at the chains. I would eat hear often if I lived here! Worth a special trip if you are visiting!
155,"This is just a fun place to get pizza. Why? Because of the people who work there. Funny guys and be sure to say hello to Greg, he is the best! The pizza is excellent as well. Good NYC pizza - Nonna Maria and also the mushroom. Go, say hi, have slice and a coke!"
156,"Best stop of our food tour. Greg, the owner, gave us a history of the place. He was so charming. We'd eat their pizza everyday if we could."
157,"Amazing pizza, some of the best we have ever had, great place to eat, very authetic inside and staff were friendly especially Greg he is awesome. Will definitely be back!"
158,"We visited for a slice of pizza for late lunch. On arrival we were surprised to see that this isn’t really a restaurant, more a takeaway with a few tables and chairs. We ordered 2 slices and the woman serving was clearly not happy in her work and merely pointed a finger, suggesting we needed to speak to her colleague. When we got the pizza it was good but not overwhelming. During our visit a homeless guy asked us to buy him a coffee and rather than the staff move him on we were left to deal with him, which we did by buying him a drink. This seemed to be disapproved of by the aforementioned woman, she should have spoken up if we were doing the wrong thing."
159,The pizza is wonderful! The Nonna Maria was my personal favorite! It is definitely worth a visit for some awesome NYC pizza!
160,"The absolute best pizza we have ever had!! Crispy crust, fresh sauce, tasty cheese. The cheese pizza and the Noni were perfection in a slice"
161,"Let me admit my bias right up front: I prefer Chicago style pizza to New York style. So Bleecker Street is never going to be my favorite pizza in the world. But for what it is, it's very good. The Nona Marie is, as everyone else said, delicious.  We also tried a calzone and a sandwich and we preferred the pizza to either of those. If you are a cheese lover, the calzone has tons. Bonus points for staying open late even as many other New York restaurants have started closing earlier due to Covid/staffing issues."
162,Dropped in here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and we were greeted at the door by Greg who found us a table for our family of 5. We got a Nonna Maria pie and it was absolutely terrific. Ten out of ten for the pizza and the genuine friendliness. This place was extremely busy and it's easy to see why. Next time we're in NYC we'll be back.
163,Wonderful pizzeria. Greg (the owner) makes you feel at home. Recommended their #1 margarita pizza and it was on point. So delicious!
164,Well.. handful of taste in a slice of pizza. Combination of great ingredients. Really enjoyed it . Highly recommend to stop by.
165,"Rating is well deserved. Had a takeout of a couple of pizzas, salad and some knots. The pizzas are huge, the bases are great and the toppings extremely generous and tasty. One pizza could easily feed four. Just great. Thanks 😊"
166,The Nonna Maria is amazing! Greg is the best! . Always have to stop in for a slice. The buffalo chicken is also fantastic
167,"You have got to try the Nona Maria pizza. Fabulous. Don’t miss this place for real NY pizza. Greg was the best host. Recommendations, history. We felt like family. Loved this place we'll def be back!"
168,In of my favorite pizza stops in nyc. Their nonna maria pizza is so delicious and the crust and dough is perfect. It is a quick bite restaurant and thry have outdoor and indoor seating. Their prices are reasonable and afforda
169,Came for a slice and ended up going back for two more. (Skipped breakfast and lunch lol) Greg recommended the Nona Maria his family recipe and it did not disappoint.
170,"Our son’s friend had taken him to Bleecker Street Pizza and he was raving about the Nona Marie pizza so much that we decided we had to try it for ourselves. The pizza was really good, definitely one of the best I’ve had. We had a whole pie between our family of four. But more than that is the warm welcome from the owner Greg who we had a great time talking to. We’ll definitely be back the next time we are in the city."
171,Such a wonderful pizza place in the heart of NY. Delicious. The recipe is Greg's grandmother's recipe. Love that it is family owned/family run. We were lucky enough to come on a Friday when Greg was working and it was clear he was happy and in his element. Go with the Nona Maria!
172,"I got a chance to try a slice of I think what's called the Nona Marie through a food tour I was on. Overall a friend and I of thought the pizza was really good, however it was a little different for me because I'm used to have pizza sauce with every bite of my pizza, so i think if the tomato ""sauce"" that they had on the pizza was on the entire pizza I would have liked it even more."
173,Bleeker street has to be the best pizza in NYC. We always go here when we’re in New York. Greg is just a fab guy to chat too. Love hearing his stories . We will be back in May and can’t wait to eat more pizza
174,"Bleecker Street Pizza was a great place to grab a slice!! We had been walking for hours and it was a blessing. Greg greeted us, made us feel welcome, and enhanced our experience there."
175,"I visited NYC for the holidays with my family from Costa Rica and we had the pleasure of eating on Bleecker Street Pizza and all that we tried was amazing. By far, the best pizza we have ever eaten. The Nona Maria was simple a delight for the senses: a perfect mixture of ingredients and a fresh basil that adds a special flavor to it. All pizzas were juicy and crusty. Definitely we will come back next time we visit NY."
176,"Pizza pilgrimage to NYC.  We came to NYC to research and sample as much NY pizza as possible as we are opening a NY style pizza restaurant back in England. We were lucky enough to speak to the owners who were so kind. They even gave us some pointers on pizza making which was amazing!  We rate the pizza here 10/10, definitely the best quality pizza slices we sampled in NYC. (And tried over 10 spots)  The staff and owners were all lovely, especially Greg (top bloke)  Thank you guys from @bromsgrovepizzaco"
177,"We visited 6 pizza by the slice places when my husband and I were in NYC for 5 days and while they were all quite good, Bleecker Street was my favorite. The pizza was soft and crispy at the same time without being overly greasy. They have a good variety of toppings and were the best at keeping production moving so they always had a good selection (some places would be out of all but 1-2 types and you'd have to wait 20+ min if you wanted something different) . I see some complaints about the service, but everyone we interacted with was perfectly pleasant and the line moved efficiently."
178,We had seen Bleecker Street Pizza on YouTube and knew we wanted to try it. It did not disappoint! Definitely the best pizza we had in New York. Special mention to Greg for his service although we did think about taking a star off when he told us he was a fan of Boris Johnson!
179,"Phenomenal, amazig, the most perfect pizza I have ever or will ever eat in my entire life.If you are walking past this place even if you are not hungry make sure you go in and try a slice. Also make sure you get the garlic knots,I live in the UK and im tempted to fly back to NYC just to visit here again."
180,"Saw this place reviewed by local people on YouTube and on our recent visit we knew we were going to try it.  Absolutely outstanding, quite frankly it's THE best slice of pizza I've ever had, the Nonna Maria was unbelievable.  Whenever we get back to NYC we will be heading here again without a doubt."
181,Pizza 10/10 especially when fresh from the oven. Customer service was non-existent to the point that I wasn't sure if our order was even being captured. Place is slightly larger than 3 years ago with a change to the layout.
182,We stopped in with a friend to introduce her to the best Pizza NY and possibly the US has to offer. Old country recipe for the sauce.  The story of how the place came into business is intriguing and a perfect reflection on what is best about New York and the people who live here.  Pizza crust is thin and the sauce awesome. Mama Nonna pizza - basic but WOW.  If you are there when Greg is working (former owner - it is still in the family) you will get a bit of history and warmth. He does like to talk to visitors.  The place can be very busy so pick your times and be prepared to wait to find seating.  Then go wandering the streets of Greenwich for dessert.
183,"Really good pizza, would highly recommend for the best pizza. Very friendly and helpful staff espeically Greg."
184,Amazing pizza slices in Greenwich. A special thanks to Greg for the warming welcome. Regards from Switzerland :-)
185,"First of all, I want to note the staff, a pleasant and sociable waiter girl, unfortunately I did not look at the name. The establishment is small and cozy. The pizza is delicious. The assortment is good, there is a lot to choose from. The prices are quite reasonable. We will definitely come back."
186,"This pizza was easily the best we’ve ever had! Perfect crust, delicious sauce and toppings. We had the pepperoni and Nonna Maria - can’t say enough great things. In addition, Greg took care of us and made our dining experience extra special!"
187,"Amazing pizza !! You have to stop here. Greg, the owner, is a gem. You can’t go wrong with your selection."
188,"Our first new york slice, absolutely amazing. Nonna Maria and bbq chicken Greg was a fantastic host very friendly and a perfect gentleman"
189,"Love the pizza, the hype was real. Greg was a great host too. Very welcoming. I'll definitely return. The texture of the crust was my favorite part"
190,Bleeker Street pizza may well be some of the best pizza in New York. It is certainly some of the best I have ever had. The place is pleasantly crowded and full of life. The ordering process is utter chaos and wonderfully New York. Enjoy the young vibrant crowd and the excellent pizza!
191,"Pizza was cold, the guy checking us out said “thank you for the tip” 3 times before I even paid, have had much better pizza in Charlotte, NC, much less NYC."
192,Amazing pizza and food.. Greg was a great host and made us feel welcome.. Definitely have to try the Nonna Maria!!! Great atmosphere!!
193,One of the best pizzas we've ever had. So crusty and delicious. We went Bleecker on a food tour and it was great. We will definitely come back.
194,"Nice, cozy, tasty + attentive service. Thanks for a pleasant evening! I will recommend to everyone :)"
195,"Have one bite of this pizza and you will quickly realize why it is rated as one of the best pizza places in NYC. The restaurant itself doesn’t have much in the way of ambiance, but the pizza is fantastic. The buffalo chicken pizza was outstanding. I highly recommend this place for a quick slice at a reasonable price. Try it and you will be back for more!"
196,"We LOVE Bleeker Street Pizza! It is by far the best pizza in NYC and quite frankly the best Pizza we have had in the US and we have had a lot of pizza! Greg, the owner, is such a nice and charming man. Go in for some pie and friendly atmosphere ❤️"
197,"My favorite pizza in the city. Nonna Maria was delicious, as well as the pepperoni jalapeño and garlic knots!! Cozy space with awesome staff, especially Greg! He was kind and courteous and made sure we were taken care of. I will definitely recommend to all I know visiting New York!"
198,Greg was amazing in how he greeted us and made us feel welcome. The nonna maria is a must try The pizza was great but his company was better.  Greg in case you're reading this - we went and had a cup of chai later in the day!
199,"Such delicious pizza has not been eaten for a long time! Cool interior, good service. There is a large company table on the third floor. The prices are very reasonable for a very central location. We will definitely come or order pizza home. Like"
200,I walked 45 minutes from my hotol to this pizzeria. The is the best pizza I have ever had. The crust was the perfect balance between crunchy and chewy. The sauce was flavorful but didn't overwhelm the toppings. I had a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. Both were good but the pepperoni was hands down my favorite. You could tell that the pepperoni was fresh amd deli made. It was sliced thickly and was spicier then store bought. I have declared this pizza a god and am willing to kill in its honor.
201,"If you are looking for good pizza, this is not the place. If you are looking for excellent, yummy New York pizza… you arrived. Delicious and Greg was lovely… warm, nice conversation. He made us feel at home."
202,Take the time to have pizza here. Gluten free pizza was really good…nice thin crust. Lots of pizza slice options are ready and the gluten free just took a few minutes. Add the fresh grated cheese too! Greg (Dad) was kind enough to deliver our food to us as we sat out front people watching….and offered to take our photo and told us about his brother who founded the restaurant.
203,"Came here for a quick bite and had about 4 slices which included pepperoni, white, cheese. Slices are ok size, maybe less generous. Taste is good. Crust is maybe too thick.  This is a place to get some simple pizza in the heart of Greenwich Village and amongst the nightlife in the area."
204,"Always stop in Bleeker Street Pizza when in town. Ingredients are fresh, employees very friendly. Greg is a great host and very informative. Took a Grandma pie home to PA and husband was thrilled Can’t wait to go back and enjoy something new."
205,"Best pizza we’ve had this side of Rome. Got the Nona Maria, their signature recipe. Special shout-out to Greg a fantastic host who treated us like family the minutes we walked in. This will be our go to place when in NYC."
206,Had the Nonna Maria three years ago and have been thinking about it ever since. Had it twice on this trip and it was excellent both times. So glad the restaurant is still going strong after COVID shutdown.
207,This was our very first stop in NYC and it did not disappoint! The white pizza and the veggie were both very good. Nice employees as well which is always a plus to me.
208,"The pizza was delicious, the perfect church and amazing flavor. Greg was very kind and welcoming, he recomended we tried the house special Nonna Maria and it did not disappoint. Overall a great slice, for a great price with great staff."
209,Wonderful true Italian pizza. Greg - one of the owners was adorable and nicely gave us the history of the place. The Nonna Maria pizza was fabulous and it's from Greg's grandmas recipe.
210,The pizza is absolutely amazing. Everything just seems so right. Beautiful small place with nice staff. Can't believe it's so cheap! Definitely will visit again.
211,This place is so freakin good. Beautiful neighborhood with outside seating available for people watching as well. They sell pizza by the slice or the whole pie. So good!!!!
212,Best pizza in NYC or the country for that matter. Sauce is the best I’ve ever had. Wish I could take it back to cali with me. We loved Greg!
213,"For such a busy place, the staff were very friendly and attentive. Slices were delicious and hot. Had a great variety of some unique flavors as well as traditional ones. We were able to order quickly, pay quickly, and get seated quickly. This is one of those spots we were happy to walk out of the way for!"
214,"My daughter and I stumbled upon this gem during her 16th birthday trip to NYC. Mr. Greg, the owner, was so kind and welcoming! We highly recommend the Nonna Maria..it was our favorite! Garlic knots are also to die for!"
215,"We visited Bleecker St based on reviews we read before our trip. I was looking for an authentic NYC pizza spot and was not disappointed. We were greeted right away by Greg, the owner. He was so kind and welcoming, which really set the mood for the whole experience. He asked us where we were from and what brought us to the city. He recommended the Nonna Maria, which is the pizza that they are famous for and it was delicious! The crust was crispy and the sauce and toppings were the perfect combination! We also had a slice of the buffalo chicken pizza. It was very good as well! Greg chatted with us while we were there and told us a few stories about 9/11 and the aftermath of the attack. All in all, it was a great meal and we are so glad we stopped in! If you’re in the city, swing by and see Greg and get some awesome pizza! You won’t regret it!"
216,came in on a food tour of Greenwich Village. was the best location on the tour and fantastic welcome by the owner. we will be back
217,Bleeker Street has been our family favorite since we lived around the corner twenty years ago! Greg the owner makes sure you get the best pizza in the city - in the best neighborhood. We love Bleeker Street Pizza!!!
218,"Great pizza, friendly hosts and quick service!! Amazing place, good air conditioning inside! בואו בהמוניכם!"
219,ended up here after discovering that John’s of Bleecker St does not serve slices. Server suggested we try this unrelated spot. Went in hoping to have a fairly traditional slice such as sausage and mushroom. The choices did not include that as they put out more unique combos like buffalo chicken. Also serve a square slice from what they call a grandma pizza. I chose the grilled chicken mozzarella slice. Slice was huge and covered with plenty of chicken. Crust here again overcrisped IMO. Sauce had a nice Italian spice profile. Really nothing special to me. Not sure how it is considered one of NY’s finest.
220,"We came based on the reviews and were not disappointed, the ingredients are perfect, taste and texture of pizza is like no other and the place is very cozy. Special thanks to Greg for his warm welcome."
221,thin pizza with pepperoni and fresh mushrooms was incredible.. I ordering it to mone and then put in on the hot pan. it becomes crispy!
222,My wife and I were very hungry . We saw this pizza place and ran into it. The pizzeria was closed! But Craig saved us and gave us some really good pizza! It was the best two slices of pizza I've ever had. I'm not kidding. Thanks guys!
223,"We visited Bleecker Street Pizza and it was truly the best pizza we ever had! We had a slice of the Nonna Maria. Highly recommend! Also, we had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners, Greg, who was extremely warm and gracious! It was a highlight of our trip! This should be on everyone's list for New York!"
224,"Other than the pizza were fantastic, greg was great. We had pepperoni and Margherita pizza and wow so good for less than 8$"
225,I have always been a fan of Joe's. But today I tried Bleeker St Pizza and I love it! Lovely attentive service!
226,Pizza was fabulous. Had white and Nonna. Greg was super welcoming. Loved the chewy and crunchy crust. Going back for sure!
227,"I live in Naples, Italy, where pizza was invented. I wrongly assumed the whole New York Pizza thing was all hype. I was walking aimlessly through the city and happened upon this place and was impressed by the previous reviews. Zero hype. The pizza here is freaking awesome."
228,"We went to Bleecker Street Pizza after visiting Little Island and walking along the Hudson River. It's on a bustling corner, near old Village streets. From the moment you step in, it's unpretentious and to-the-point. Most of the clients seem to be regulars. The staff is efficient and the pizzas are displayed so you get a good grasp of what you're getting. Keeping to its matter-of-fact style, Greg, who is looking over the place, tells us (when we point out the pictures that adorn the walls) that more celebrities come here than a rehab. Then he asks us where we are from and we chat a bit about all the different people that come to the restaurant - he looks forward to seeing more people from all over the world again after the pandemic finally ends. We take our trays of pizza outside and sit overlooking the myriad characters walking around the Village. The pizza is wonderful, the ingredients are fresh, their combination is finely balanced and the crust has a nice crunch to it. Greg walks over to us and offers parmesan cheese, which tops off the pizza with a great little umami taste. When we are done, we rest for a bit, slurping on our self-serve beverages, before heading out to continue walking around. Through Bleecker Street Pizza, the city has shown a bit of its true, unassuming but generous face."
229,"We decided to try this place while on vacation in NYC. Gary, the former owner and brother to the late founder greeted us at the door and was very friendly and helpful. He told us some history, asked questions about our family and hometown and showed us the different dishes they had. The pizza was outstanding. We had a very good lunch there. I will be back."
230,My friend recommended me to Bleecker Street Pizza and I am so grateful they did! The slice you get is huge and absolutely delicious. Definitely lives up to all the hype and then some.
231,"People say the pizza here tastes amazing, and I have to agree. One of the best pizza's I've had. And definitely worth the visit for NYC pizza if you're ever in the City.  The slices are enormous, and cheap too. They're also freshly made. Tons of seating available with air conditioning if it's boiling hot outside."
232,"Bleeker Street has some of the best pizza I have ever had. It is no frills, inexpensive and delicious! The setting is low key with great people watching on 7th Ave. The owner was there when we went for lunch and he was very friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next trip to NYC so we can head back to Bleeker for a slice!"
233,"In my 73 years, I cannot recall a pizza more delicious than this one... the Grandma with vegetables."
234,"This was our 3rd NYC trip and we somehow missed this place on our first visit….but never again! We tried Bleecker St two years ago, and made a promise to go back on this visit. We landed on a Monday at 3:00 at LGA, and we were eating this pizza at 5:00-yes our first stop in NYC after checking into hotel.  The Nonna Maria is our favorite no doubt! We just wish we could’ve taken a whole pizza back to a Texas! Do yourself a favor and get to Bleecker Street Pizza sooner rather than later!"
235,"Amazing pizza! We're visiting from St. Louis and this is the best New York pizza we've had. Also, Greg is the best!!"
236,"This is by far the BEST pizza I have ever tasted. I recommend ordering the Nonna Maria. It's so delicious. The sauce is so good! Thanks, Bleecker Street Pizza for bringing happiness to my tummy!"
237,Only had one pizza stop on our quick NYC weekend so I did my research and landed on picking Bleecker Street and I’m so so glad we did. NYC pizza at its best! Fast service in a great part of town. We were not disappointed. Definitely get a slice or two of the Nonna Maria - every bit as delicious as the hype.
238,"We've tried pizza in many parts of the city, Brooklyn, and other parts of the country and still think the Nonna Maria from Bleecker St Pizza is the best! This is the perfect blend of sauce and cheese, and the crust is amazing! We were lucky to meet Greg (the owner) this visit and he took the time to stop and talk with us and share stories about his brother who was the original owner. If you haven't been here before, it should definitely be on your list!"
239,We had Bleeker Street pizza on our NYC food tour and it was amazing! After we went back uptown we wish we had ordered a whole pie yo go back to the hotel! I need this pizza in Florida!
240,"Yep - I said it. We've eaten a lot of pizza in Manhattan after living there for 15 years. This is some of the best we've had. We tried the sausage, Nonna, plain and pepperoni and holy crap every slice was incredible. I'm talking mouth-watering, finger-licking unbelievably good. And the people who work there are so lovely."
241,This is some of the best pizza I tried and the staff was very nice as well. It was also quite cheap and the portions were huge. Highly recommend!
242,"Great sliced pizza with tin crust. Service was very fast, as fast as in the normal times (I've visited them before). I see that they have outdoor seating, too!"
243,"I really loved Bleecker Street Pizza. Excellent pizza at times of pandemic, where good ""junk"" food is scarce. I'll definitely visit again soon!"
244,"Stopped there for lunch (1/10/21) as we were exploring Greenwich Village . Since they sell by the slice, we wanted to sample a few of the pies they offer. We went with buffalo chicken, Nonna Maria (margherita) and grilled chicken - all delicious, fresh and had crispy crusts. Great customer service. The 2 gentleman working behind the counter were kind, patient and helpful. Outdoor dining and take-out available."
245,Prices were normal. Staff was kind. Foods were delicious. I ordered three slices of Italian pizza and taste was alike what I ate in Rome. Thanksssss
246,"The joint was jumping, 11:30 PM on a Saturday night. There was requisite Covid outside dining with a couple of tables open on the inside. The glass case/counter assembly style walk up, reminded me of an SNL sketch—the available pies were showcased for sale while staff members shouted at the patrons in line to step it up, give their order. Still, they were efficient, quick and polite The pizza was exceptional. Thin crispy crusted, ample fresh ingredients, large slices, reasonably priced — big yum. Pizza 9, ambience of dining room 0. Worth the calories"
247,"After having tried several pizzas in NY I think this is the best pizza in New York so far, the combinations and the ingredients, the service is very good and friendly, TripAdvisor is right it is the best!"
248,"Excellent pizza - for a quick slice. Not much ambience but if you want an excellent slice, come here. The dough was thin and crunchy and almost melted away. The toppings were great. Easy to find a seat as the turnover is high. I had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was really flavorful and good - not too spicy that it melted the roof of your mouth, just the right amount of “kick”. I also had the pepperoni and it was very solid, with the crust again being really wonderful."
249,Great pizza. A Must stop in new york city among others going back before i leave to go home great pizza
250,The service is very good. I delivered the pizza at 10.00 PM and I received at 10:15 excellent! I recommend.
251,If you are looking for a fast eating place for a cheap pricezthis is the place where you should go.Yummmyyy
252,"I just randomly went in for a pizza. Want to tell you that once you go in you will be amazed at the nice fresh pizza smell. Ordered one slice and to be honest, I had to order another one as it was soooo goooddd. The Owner is a very nice person, and very friendly. I will recommend this place to everybody. You must try it and obviously shake hands with the owner. The story of the shop is amazing. Greetings from 2 Hungarians"
253,"New Yorker pizza during stay in NYC is a must. Thanks to TripAdvisor/GoogleMaps proposals, I knew that must visit place is Bleecker Street Pizza. This is a low-cost so don't worry that it's not fancy. Actually in this case, it's a positive. Place is pretty small but big enough to not to miss it. There is a huge variety of pizzas which you can order as normal pizza or per slice. If you are not sure which one is good, the staff is very friendly and communicative. It was so delicious and the slice were so huge, that we visited this place 3 times during our stay. Credit/debit cards allowed. It's a must visit place in NYC."
254,We wandered in without reading any reviews and we are glad we did. We had the recommended Nonna Maria pizza with extra fresh basil and we were warmly greeted by Greg and the rest of the staff. Great place for a cheap quick pitstop and the pizza is really good. We will be back.
255,"Thin crunchy crust, good ratio sauce to cheese. Great atmosphere, lovely host Greg. Definitely “must try” if you in NYC."
256,"Pizza was delicious 10/10 would reccomend. Greg was really nice. A must if you're in the area. Group of us from Dublin, Irl had a brilliant time."
257,"Sought out Bleecker Street Pizza after reading other reviews, and we were not disappointed. The eager and on task team behind the counter were fun to watch as they kept track of the orders and warmed up the slices. I had the Nona Marie, my wife had a slice of the white, and both were served hot with crisp crusts. They don’t have beer on tap, but a nice selection of bottled beer to enjoy with the pizza. Side note, it’s only a couple of blocks from the Friend’s apartment."
258,"Amazing Pizza! Best Pizza in NYC! Greg was very welcoming, took pictures for us to have something lasting of our trip. We had their No.1 Pizza and a slice of 3 meat Pizza. Always fresh and big slices!!!"
259,"Not a sit down restaurant, several small tables in back, but Really Really good slices, tried a couple and was not disappointed. Grab a bunch of napkins, you'll need them."
260,"Excellent pizza: huge slices: fresh, tasty, light and greaseless! If you’re fortunate enough to have Greg stop by your table, your day will be made. We will be back and we want more Greg!"
261,"Had the Nonna Maria - amazing. The cheese, tomato and herbs just all came together magically, and the crust is crispy and to die for. Got the chance to meet Greg as well and he made us feel right at home. It’s a cozy restaurant and the pizza is the best in NY. Must try.  - Zheng Jie, Singapore"
262,Try the Nona Maria. Next time I come I am going to buy a few extra slices to take home with me. We had one slice that we warmed up in the microwave in our hotel the next morning and it was still fantastic. They stay open pretty late. I went there at 1:30am and there was a line to the door.
263,We prefer traditional stone baked pizza compare to this style which has a crunchy base. I'm glad we tried it and would recommend it to others but wouldn't say this is the best in NY.
264,"We were recommended this pizzeria which we decided to have lunch at after a walking tour of the village. It did not disappoint, the crust was amazing and the pizza itself was light and tasty."
265,"BEST PIZZA IN TOWN! I tried a few pizzas from places claiming to be the best, but none beat this place. Make sure you go!"
266,"During a recent visit to New York we had many places/things to see and do. Bleeker street pizza was one I was dying to try. Had seen a few videos on YouTube featuring this place so had to search it out! After a walk along the high line and stopping off at Chelsea market (both worth a visit) we had a short walk to Bleeker street pizza. If you haven't been to New York before, a word of warning!! You will walk loads!! Most casual pizza places in New York don't do tables and chairs, just a pokey little shelf to stand at! At Bleeker street pizza you will find some tables and chairs, which was massively needed as our feet were throbbing! Between 3 of us (youngest son is weird and doesn't eat pizza) we tried a slice of the Cheese pizza, Nonna Maria, Mushroom, Grandma, pepperoni, and then went back for another cheese.... amazing! The thin crust has a crusty outer but isn't hard! It's lovely and soft with a slight crunch. It's also got a taste to it that I've not come across before?? The sauce is special too! Herby but not over powering! The grandma has a slightly thicker base but it's not doughy and heavy, like other pizzas,it's light! It's difficult to describe, I'm not doing it justice, so just make sure if you're in New York, find this place and give it a try! Don't waste your time with those slice for a dollar pizza places, they don't compare! This is the real deal!! Enjoy!!"
