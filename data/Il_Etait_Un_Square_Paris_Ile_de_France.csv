0,"The burgers and tartares were amazing, savory d’extravagance. Super friendly and fast service. Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu."
1,Best burger I’ve ever had. As an American I’ve loved cheeseburgers my whole life. I eat them all the time back home. The people are amazing and it’s reflected in their food as well. I want to try everything on the menu before I go home. Thanks for having me!  -The King of Connecticut
2,"It was great food, really friendly staff who was nice to us about not knowing much French - thank you for a great time!! Also good music!"
3,"Burgers: 10/10 Fries: 10/10 10/10 Ambience 10/10 Service 10/10 Cost 10/10 Honestly, great food with prompt and courteous service!"
4,Very good Burger Place and and excellent Mousse au chocolat! surely to try out. A little outside of center but worth a visit. If I'm not wrong almost everything is homemade.
5,"a little bit removed from Paris's main tourist attractions, yet easily accessible via metro. Excellent burgers and a helpful, friendly service."
6,"After a day touring Versailles we stopped here for a late lunch. We all ordered burgers, the Cheddar, the Bleu and whatever the burger of the day was. All 3 were so tasty! The fries were great too. Even better was the friendly staff who all welcomed us with a smile."
7,"Located a little bit far from the main places of interest in Paris, but easily reachable by metro. Friendly and kind staff and absolutely outstanding burger."
8,"Burger Fun Fun Burger Joint which is Unpretentious and a Great Place to Hang Out. Seems to be in the student quarter (though admittedly my knowledge of Parisian districts is limited)  Positives • Big portions • Very friendly hostess, staff, and bartender • Really appreciated their accommodation of our late arrival and general friendliness  Negatives • Wine recommendation was decent but perhaps the palettes did not align • A bit out of the way to get to and in a university area • Food was not the draw, but rather the friendly vibe"
9,Fantastic food!! 😋 Delicious steaks - cooked to perfection 3 kids burger meals....no waste so must've been great Great chat/banter with the hosts ....they knew where Wales was....gets an extra star ⭐ Highly recommended 😄
10,"We had heard so much about this place and took a 40 min cab to get there for our last meal in Paris before flying back to New Zealand. We ate the burgers, beef tartare and salmon tartare - it tastes absolutely sensational, by far the best we’ve ever had. Was well worth the visit!!"
11,Visited here on our last night in Paris. Amazing atmosphere and absolutely amazing burgers. So welcoming and helpful. Thank you
12,"On our last trip I had wished to have lunch here, but was unable to do so. My husband and I decided to give it a try this visit to France. The burgers were outstanding and the service friendly and timely. I would highly recommend the restaurant if you love burgers. There are many varieties to choose from."
13,"We got the burgers based on recommendations and they did not disappoint. If I ever go back, I would try the one with the egg on top. (I saw it on my neighbor's plate :) ) Servers were very attentive and helpful!"
14,"My husband and I came here for dinner on our first night in Paris for our honeymoon. Literally the BEST burger I have ever had in my life. The service was so great as well. Owner greeted us right away and even asked where we were visiting from. Our waiter was super nice and very friendly! 10/10 recommend! And if we ever take another trip to Paris, we will be returning!!"
15,It was probably the best burger I had in my life! Especially the waiters were really friendly and asked us always if we need something! Highly recommended 🙏🏼
16,The best tartar I have eaten! So fresh and flavorful! My husband had a cheeseburger and also agreed that the beef was superb. French fries were crispy and the environment was comfortable and friendly.
17,"We were in Paris for a long weekend looking for somewhere to eat, we checked on Tripadvisor and found this restaurant “Etait Un Square” which was highly recommended on Tripadvisor. We were very close so decided to give it a go. Wow! this place is above & beyond!! It was absolutely packed out when we arrived with a fantastic atmosphere, we managed to speak to Gerard who turned out to be one of the owners and he went out of his way to squeeze us into a brilliant table. I had the burger one word “wow” my husband had the Steak Tartare which he said was amazing. The service, the food, the atmosphere, 10/10 could not have been more pleased with our choice. Highly recommend."
18,I have tried till now burgers. Steak tartares and crevices ! All are just perfect! Best French fries and ketchup in town !
19,"My brother and visited Il Etait Un Square in Paris, having been encouraged to go there by the stellar reviews and we were not disappointed. The staff are delightful and gave us a very warm welcome. The burger was excellent; I ordered the Cheddar, served well done (probably a rarity here) and it was, as far as I am concerned, perfectly executed being succulent wile still being well done. Everything else was excellent too. Chips were cooked to perfection, the Cretan Salad and egg mayonnaise (I believe the mayonnaise was home made) were also excellent as was the ketchup (of a type I have not seen in the UK) and the trimmings. Even the wine recommendation was well judged. We really could not ask for more. Strongly recommended - I intend to return."
20,I visited twice on an extended stay in Paris. First time I had the Napoleon Burger which was excellent. Second visit I has the Gascon tartare which was also fantastic. Burgers as good as the best I have had in the US and Europe. If you are a burger fan this place is a must visit. Service was friendly but not overly intrusive and for the tourists there is no snootiness if French language is not your forte.
21,I came with my brother for the day to Paris and booked Il Etait Un Square as it was so well rated. It was definitely worth it - delicious food matched by charming service and the owner made us feel so welcome. We'll be back Merci pour tout!
22,"I only review when a place is truly exceptional, beyond 5 star, and here is one such. The food and the staff were truly wonderful. I had been amazed that a burger place could be rated the 2nd best Paris restaurant of 19,000 on trip advisor, so I had to try it, and it stood up. I highly recommend, and even to make a detour. I was a little concerned when I arrived as there was no-one yet there, but it quickly filled up. The staff were perfectly attentive, confident and jolly, without in any way getting in the way; and the burgers and steak tartar (my first of the latter) were of a quality that I rarely, if ever, tasted. Exceptional quality of meat, melt in mouth. Bravo. The burger I had was the Napoleon 1er, (because am English and Waterloo) and the tartar was 'Hongroie', a special. So good"
23,Excellent burgers coupled with reasonable prices. Great atmosphere and lovely staff. May require a reservation but not necessarily.
24,One of the best burgers I have ever eaten and my partner agreed. Very welcoming host and staff! Explained everything to do with the restaurant and how they make their burgers. Very personable host and the food was absolutely delicious. Reasonably priced and well worth every penny. Would 100% recommend if you are visiting Paris.
25,"Very very good. Great food, good service, overall pleasant experiance. And I eat a lot of burgers. Certanly the best burger I've eaten outside of my home country (Slovenia has high burger standard :p). I also liked the menu: diverse, wide enough to have a choice, but not overwhelming. Would recommend. Next time I gotta try steak!"
26,"The Burger was great and the melted cheese sause plus the fries was the best i ever had! Well worth an visit when in Paris, will come back!"
27,"One of the best burgers we had until now.  As we approached the restaurant which is located on the corner of a quite neighborhood just a few minutes walk from the metro train station and entered it, a friendly face greeted us asking if we had a reservation as the restaurant was packed, this was on a Tuesday night.  We confirmed that we did and politely asked if we were able to seat outside noticing afterwords that there were no available tables outside but only the one which was reserved for us inside the restaurant.  In a time frame of 2-3 minutes they arranged a new table and four chairs outside as requested, without even arguing that our reserved table was inside etc.  We got seated and the menus approached. Burgers and tartars of all kinds and twists at very reasonable prices.  No need to say that the food was excellent as well as the service.  Our daughters kept thumps upping the owners as this were one of their best burgers they had and unfortunately for me, better then mine ! :)  We thank you for your hospitality, we had a great evening and we wish you all to continue with the same passion and quality."
28,The food was just amazing! One of the best burgers I’ve ever eaten. The hostess was very friendly. I recommend to everyone that travels/ or live in the city to go to this place!
29,Definitely worth visiting. If you are in town on vacation take the trip over here. Such a quaint area. The staff here are very friendly. The food is amazing.
30,"If you are looking for super hamburgers in a cosy restaurant with very friendly service, this is definitely the right place!"
31,"We tried 3 burgers - Le Bleu, Le Cheddar, Le Chedo Pepper, and a Curry Burger that was the Daily Special. We cut all 4 into 4 and shared them around the table. The Chedo Pepper may have gotten the most accolades and Le Bleu was the least favorite. That said, we polished them off, licking our fingers. We all said it was one of the best burgers we have ever had.  We arrived at 2:15pm and were told the kitchen was closing. Neverthless, we got a nice window front table and the owner talked to us for a long time. He had visited the US and had lots to share about his experience there. Super tasty and friendly place for lunch."
32,"Fabulous place to go particularly with a family. Excellent service, friendly, welcoming, fun staff and the food is incredible. Simple on one hand but so delicious! Went as family for daughters birthday which they acknowledged with fun and kindness, worth a trip to Paris to just go here!!"
33,"Arrived to be greeted by the friendly owner and his team. With tables both inside and outside the atmosphere was relaxed and the staff took us through the menu including burgers, steak and tartare. Opting for the Napoleon burger, spicy and the beef steak, we were not disappointed. Desserts were a homemade treat. Would definitely recommend."
34,Great lunch place! Plenty of outdoor seating. Burgers were delicious after a day of walking around. I can see why it's gotten such terrific reviews!
35,"They are very kind and welcoming, the food is very tasty and you can find a great variety of burgers and meats. Good beers. We will came again!"
36,"I came here due to all the great reviews. The food is good, but way off the beaten path and in my opinion, not worth going, unless you are in the area. The wait staff was very friendly, however the food was just average. I had the recommended burger with fries and it was good. Lots of empty seats when I went, so not sure if reservations are really needed."
37,The food was amazing and the burger is a start and the staff were very welcoming...the dessert also a must try... Definitely a good choice...
38,Amazing food and good service. Will definitely come back again. Had an humborger and tartar. Also an amazing starters.
39,The restaurant is in a calm area so it’s nice to sit outside. Staff is really friendly and helpful with the menu. The food is more than ok but not something I would call amazing. I would recommend it for the overall experience.
40,"Located away from the busy city centre of Paris this eatery is well worth a trip  Waiting staff were welcoming to all and speak exemplary English , making the experience very comfortable.  The restaurant specialises in burgers and Tartares , I opted for the chedd pepper , a bacon and cream peppercorn cheddar cheese burger with caramelised onions, I truthfully have never had a better burger anywhere.  The relaxed atmosphere , excellent food and dutiful service make this a must try for burger lovers.  Pricing was very reasonable for Paris , a Belgian beer , soft drink , coffee and main meal came in around 30 euros , which at this quality felt like a bargain. Highly recommend."
41,"The best burger we’ve ever had—and we’ve made it our mission to find the best burgers in our lifetime. Nothing will top our experience here! High quality food, more than fair prices, relaxed environment, friendly people."
42,"Delicious - nothing more to say! The service was great, the food was extraordinary and the location was cozy an welcoming. Best Dinner we had in Paris!"
43,"Quick service, amazing burgers and friendly staff! Made to feel very welcome (especially as visiting from England). A lovely atmosphere! Would recommend!"
44,The burger tasted excellent and it had a very natural taste. It was the best one I ever had. The service was very good and quick. Everyone was very nice and had a smile on their face.
45,"Absolutely amazing burgers and beef tart, also the staff was friendly and made us feel special.Thank you and hopefully see you soon again.Strongly recommend!!!"
46,"Good neighborhood restaurant. Burgers overall were but a bit too much cheese. The crumble cake super tasty as well (not too sweet but enough sweetness). Service was ok, nothing exceptional. The restaurant deco, nothing amazing as well."
47,"The food was good, especially the sauce, it tasted great, the atmosphere was relaxing and good, and the staff were very good. I recommend it here. Community Verified icon"
48,"Burgers 10/10 Fries 10/10 Atmosphere 10/10 Service 10/10 Cost 10/10 Honestly, great food with quick and kind service!"
49,came here based off of trip advisor rating and was not disappointed. The food was brilliant and the service was top notch. Menu is Burger and steak but the variations are really good. Definitely recommend.
50,The hamburger was very very delicious :) Nice service :) From Hungary Mindenkinek csak ajánlani tudom ! Igazi hangulatos kis hely !
51,Everything about this restaurant was wonderful. The staff are charming and the food sensational. Delicious burger and yummy steak tartare - just wow 🥰 Will definitely return next time we are back in this beautiful city.
52,"For one of the best burgers, visit Il Etait Un Square. We really enjoyed the meal and also the service staff did their best to offer a good experience."
53,"I made a reservation with the restaurant, the staff spoke very well. And it's my first time trying food here. Service is fast and there friendly staff The food is great especially the hamburgers."
54,The staff were incredibly friendly and happy to accommodate English speakers. The atmosphere was excellent and the food even better. The burger was probably the best burger I’ve ever had and I would definitely return the next time I visit Paris
55,"Really yummy burgers with a local crowd/vibe and passionate staff. The produce and meat was fresh and the meal enjoyable. I came here alone without reservation for a late lunch and they were able to sit me down and serve me. Staff was super friendly and helpful, and answered all my questions. I ordered Le Cheddar and they asked how I’d like it cooked and I said however the chef likes (which is my usual response when trying something new). Just keep in mind that’s super super rare here - like tartar - which is totally fine!! Just came as a bit of a surprise coming from USA/Canada . It was a reputable space and everyone was eating them just like that, so I enjoyed mine as well. Meat was very fresh and bread tasted yummy too. I would return again, alone or with a group of friends."
56,My daughter and I were looking for restaurants on the internet and came across this one. It was also later recommended by a friend. It’s a very quiet cozy place and the owner and staff were super friendly. They were so helpful and made us feel welcomed into their establishment. They answered any and all questions we had and the food was amazing! We plan to try to go back before we leave Paris. We both got the chicken skewer with the rice and salad. The rice had this amazing cheese on it and it was so delicious!
57,"Lovely staff, relaxed atmosphere, food was delicious! The owner was very welcoming and great at speaking English. Would visit again 😊"
58,"Il Etait Un Square - the best hamburgers in Paris. I went on Trip Advisor looking for a lunch spot. Il Etait Un Square was recommended for their hamburgers. I made a reservation. Although, depending on the time of day you may not need one. We took an Uber there. We went today. The food was amazing. The owner came to our table to explain the food choices. I had “The Blue”, my son has “The Cajun” and my hubby had “The Chedd Pepper”. The food was moderately priced. We paid about $60 Euro. Check it out if you want some great food.  Here are some pics:"
59,"Having read so many positive reviews of this restaurant we gave it a try in our last night. We had left it late but managed to book a table on their website and we’re glad we did.  It’s a cosy restaurant off the main road on the corner of a small crossroads. It’s outside the main touristy area and seemed full of locals enjoying the evening.  When the owner heard we spoke English, he asked us where we were from - there was no attitude towards us for not speaking French, something we received in a few other places. He sat down with us and explained the menu which was a nice touch. The waiter who followed him spoke just as good English and everything was said and done with a smile.  The burgers were lovely and the desserts stuck with us for the evening."
60,Back again to this lovely restaurant. Gerard was there to welcome us with such warmth it was so lovely. I had a steack tartare and it was delicious. My son Joley loved his burger and the whole family just felt like home. Thank you again for this lovely lunch.
61,Found this through Tripadvisor and when I saw the reviews I thought we had to visit and see for ourselves. Definitely not disappointed!! Best burger I’ve ever had. The staff was warm and friendly and the atmosphere really cosy. A ‘must-go’ in Paris!!
62,"We went there after a long walk in tbe chan elisa to arc de triumph. The metro was very easy and we were glad we came. We had two vegeterian dishes which were great. Quiet place , great host , lovely vibe. Plus - great price. Under 40 euro for two dishes a glass of wine and beer. We didnt have time for ther desert but we'll be back ."
63,Booked approximately 6 months ago when we knew we were going to Paris and heard so many awesome reviews. All I can say is they over exceeded my expectations!!! The service 10/10 the food 10/10 and the cost 10/10. The owner was a very nice guy and all the waiters were very helpful and friendly Regards Lee and Gemma
64,"We were visiting Paris with our teenage sons for the weekend and booked this restaurant near to our hotel, we were not disappointed, absolutely AMAZING burgers! We all wished we had a chance to eat here again as it was such an enjoyable meal, the boys love their burgers and said they were the best they ever had, big praise indeed! Also had some delicious desserts, lovely atmosphere, really friendly staff, very reasonably priced and was full of locals which is also a good sign, would highly recommend."
65,If you want to eat a burger in Paris then this is the place to go. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the burgers are seriously good. (Les Ecossais)
66,"We were very happy with our decision to visit the restaurant for lunch.  Staff were very friendly, speaks good English to accommodate us since we do not speak any French. Brought the menu board right in front of us to explain their menu and their specials for the day.  I had the class Tartare and the portion is very generous! My husband has his burger and was on cloud nine.  The apple pie was delicious, served with a huge amount of cream of the side.  Highly recommend this place. I see this place is also patronised by regular local residents."
67,Excellent excellent excellent. Fantastic hospitality and even better food. Seriously some of the best food I’ve ever had. It’s also in a great location
68,"Elegant restaurant, typically French. The staff was very helpful and attentive. Delicious French food and relaxing atmosphere. Not too long, but decent wine list. When we are in Paris, we will definitely come back!"
69,"The staff who served us were all so lovely and friendly, very helpful with explaining the menu to us, if you're nervous about that as a tourist. We had two different burgers and they were both amazing, along with amazing dessert and wine. Very reasonably priced, would absolutely recommend!"
70,"Found this restaurant on trip advisor, and when you see ratings like that, I always feel like I’m gonna be let down. But not here.  Quite simply the best burger I’ve ever tasted. The burger itself is unreal (had mine medium), but the cheese my god. I am salivating thinking about it now. The chips were also fantastic.  You simply must eat here. They offer some other items like chicken skewer on the menu, but you’d be insane not to have the burger."
71,"We had high expectations considering the ranking of this restaurant and it was just very good and met the bar Service is great, people so nice and professional Burgers were *really* good!!"
72,The burgers were amazing and the staff was super friendly. The place is very homely and everything on the menu sounded good. A must try if you are in Paris
73,Lunch here was great. Service was very welcoming and there was a good atmosphere. I had the steak tartare there which was rustic and delicious. The place specialise in burgers and tartare and they really do them well. My girlfriend had the raclette burger that was a special which was mega too. Visited from Liverpool.
74,"A fantastic little place with amazing food, we were very impressed with our burgers and all said they were the best we’d ever had."
75,"“Le bleu” burger was the most delicious burger I’ve ever had. The place is not very big, but has a cozy touch. We also tried the burger of the month, but we were more impressed by the “bleu” one."
76,"I've never had a better burger. The guys were so nice and accommodating! For family and friends, this is a must-see!"
77,Being from the United States I have had many types of burgers. I have to say that this burger was the best that I ever had. I had the Burger special of the day and it was just oosin with cheese and awesome taste. My wife had the Turkey Burger that was also very tasty and my daughter had the Veggie Burger. The owner came out with a walking menu that was awesome to see and he explained everything and was right on point. Dessert was fabulous too. All in All great restaurant with awesome food and great atmosphere. When we visit Paris again it will be on our list!!! AAAA++++
78,Absolutely amazing! We had the tradional tartare and the french burger. The tartare was so fresh and full of flavor. The french burger - we didn't expect it to be so good but it was incredible. Plus the staff were incredibly nice. Will definitely return when we visit Paris again :)
79,"If you are a burger fan, this is a must visit when you are in Paris. The location is a bit out of the way but it is worth the visit. Service was great, and the burgers were amazing!! Everything was fresh and delicious. We have tried many burgers in the US and the burgers here are on another level. We will be coming back when we visit again."
80,The best burger I have ever tasted. The people where very nice and welcoming! Highly recommend for families and friends!
81,"We had an unexpected 24 hours in Paris and we’re so glad we did after finding Il était un square. Even though we were a good 45 mins late to our reservation (got lost, under estimated travel times, and misremembered booking ) the owner greeted us with a smile and warm welcome. The food was delicious. We look forward to visiting again next time we’re in Paris!"
82,"Il était un square is an must-try bistro south of the Seine with *delicious* French burger and beef tartare dishes, world-class fries and homemade mayo. A short walk from the Catacombs and the Panthéon, do yourself a favor and stop by for lunch or dinner in this delightful, light, fun, and quintessentially Parisian atmosphere. You won't be disappointed, it's obvious why this is a local favorite and worth the visit every time!"
83,"Had 3 burgers and beef tartare to start, all very good and the guys there very happy to help and explain all the dishes, beef tartare was one of the best I've tried definitely would recommend it."
84,Visited on spur of the moment. Manager and staff incredibly friendly from the start. Both had vegetarian burger and it was truly delicious. Tiramisu and apple crumble topped it off. Thoroughly recommend.
85,I really enjoy the time when in Paris. I am fascinated by their wonderful culture and food. I will do it again
86,The food was excellent. The service was super fast and the staff were very nice. We had a main and a pudding and both were incredible. The burger is the best I’ve ever had!
87,"Being from US I am very critical when I see a burger joint. This was one of the best burgers I have ever tried. Amazing food, friendly staff and owners. Would definitely come back here every time I visit Paris."
88,"I came for the burger but stayed for the tartare ;) actually i was really looking for a nice burger that day and they looked really good, but I wanted to try the tartare and was delicious !! The waitress and the chef himself were very nice and friendly. I strongly recommend it. The location is very cozy as well :)"
89,"Indeed it's an address that you wouldn't regret, great food and excellent service, the stuff were very polite and active. the atmosphere itself is great. I highly recommend"
90,"I ordered the Blue Burger, personally I like my Burger medium rare which not many establishments are able to offer due to the meat needing to be freshly minced steak. As this place is an advertised steak tar tar and Burger restaurant, what could be more perfect?  And it was just that, the best Burger I've ever eaten- it has taken 7 years to find a Burger to take the top spot but this did it. Great place and great staff, food cooked quickly and huge portions, would highly recommend."
91,"Staff was the highlight. They were all so kind, helpful, and welcoming! The burgers were delicious. We ordered the cheddar and the Max burger. The fries were also delicious!"
92,"Excellent burgers in a friendly place! We so much enjoyed the food and we were happy to meet the friendly staff. The atmosphere was lovely, warm welcome, food came fast and it was delicious . I totally recommend. See you next time ! The Greeks from Belgium :-)"
93,Very nice place where you can enjoy the best food. I was there with my friends and we would like to come again.
94,"Quaint Restaurant, really friendly helpful owner and staff. Has to be one of the nicest burgers we have ever tasted. Just happen to come along on our Vespa through the streets of Paris and decided to have a quick bite. The owner was so nice and the staff were lovely. The beef burgers we ordered was the restaurant special and it was absolutely delicious. 10 out of 10 for service and of course the food. If you have a chance to visit you won’t be disappointed."
95,"Lovely experience. Was our first visit in Paris and was 10/10 all round. Excellent service, was given a very helpful guide on their food and how it is cooked. Food was delicious, will certainly be back."
96,"Myself, wife and son were on a weekend visit to Paris and had seen the positive reviews for Il Etait Un Square on Tripadvisor, so trekked there after visiting the Eiffel Tower. It was about an hour walk (note to self; Use the metro next time), but totally worth the effort.  The minute we walked in we were welcomed with a warm smile and a super-friendly greeting and knew immediately we'd made a great choice. We were given a choice of where to sit and once we were settled were run through the menu with a great explanation of what was on offer. Sadly, our French is appalling but fortunately for us, their English was excellent.  When the food came it was just what we'd hoped for and the only problem we had was that we couldn't finish it! Chicken and beef burgers were excellent, fries tasty and crisp and some nice, fresh salad on the side. What's not to like?  Could have happily stayed and chilled out for a while but a visit to the Louvre was scheduled so we had to leave. As we were paying, our waitress who had obviously finished her shift and was leaving to go home made a point of saying goodbye to us as she left.  Would come back in a heartbeat - but I'd use the metro next time!"
97,"Good experience , I didn't booked a table but they have space for me. The service was amazing very friendly staff. The food is exceptional."
98,We ordered one blu gamburger and taratar steak .both very testy and when in paired with good red winePeyre La gazette it began be excellent. We very liked service of our waitress polite and charming yung woman.
99,"This place was super good. We didn’t have a reservation so we got there right when it opened ; we were lucky enough to kindly be seated and welcomed in. We speak English but tried our best attempt at French , but we were welcomed in a warm way and made to feel at home. Now, with that all being said, the burgers (cheddar, and Mac) and tartare (gascon) were awesome. The tartare was much better and easier to eat than expected (we were a bit nervous) and would definitely recommend. The creamy cheese (not melted) was to die for and was a specialty for sure. Being from America we thought we’ve had some great burgers but this may top even the best we have at home, give it a try and be kind to the people working , they made our time great and will make yours great too!"
100,"When traveling from Moscow to Paris, do not expect the trip to be so pleasant and pleasant, I really liked everything, I hope to return soon to this beautiful city and try the delicious food of this restaurant again!"
101,We loved this place! We were accommodated by the owner besides we had no reservation and were so tired to find another place to eat. It was really a huge surprise to have such a tasty food and a nice atmposphere! The burgers were the best we've ever had! A great choice for everyone.
102,"The team were warm, welcoming. If I’m really, really wanting a burger, this one is fine to good. Meat is fresh for sure and the burger is large even by US standards. Cheeses, melted into and on top of burger, are creamy. Bun is cold and less appealing. Fries are average. It’s a high energy fun environment."
103,"Paris is packed with really great Bistros, Brasseries and Restaurants, but sometimes - particularly when staying for an extended trip - its nice to have something simple - and a really good burger can often hot the spot. We found ""Il Etait Un Square"" on trip advisor rated #2 RESTAURANT in Paris, booked our table, and set off with high expectations. There is nothing wrong with this restaurant, and the Burgers were definately the right side of okay, but nothing really special. Bun could have been served warm, chips were tepid and not quite crisp enough, beef patty itself was a bit mean, and the prices too high for the quality. Staff were very friendly and the service was fast - which perhaps was one of the problems....there was no way the burger and chips could have been freshly prepared in the time between placing our order and receiving the food. Good choice of (non-french) beers. If you are in the area, then give it a try by all means; but if in the centre of town, Five Guys is a far better (and cheaper) choice for a great burger."
104,"We found this restaurant on Trip Advisor and tried it base on it's review. It did not disappoint. Great service, great burgers and great value. We'll be back on out next visit."
105,"The burgers and fries here were absolutely phenomenal! A must visit spot if you're into delicious hamburgers. Also, the owner and staff are so kind and caring. Highly recommend going here!!"
106,"This is a MUST go to restaurant if you are an American visiting Paris! The owner was so caring and even asked what state we are from (Florida) and ended up adding a cute palm tree drink stirrer, the waitresses were awesome as well and made sure we enjoyed our meal! I am definitely coming back here the food was amazing and was an experience you will not get any where else! Mercí!!!"
107,The best burger ever It was so tasty Also the people there are so friendly Don't miss!!!!! Its just the best
108,Delicious burgers. I ordered the Max burger and it was excellent. With some fries and salad on the side. Really enjoyed it.
109,"Very good service and excellent burgers, would recommend a stop if you're nearby. Few Parisians seem to welcome Americans so much."
110,huge burger with tons of cheese. we took 1 for 2 people and it was enough. gonna go again when in paris
111,"We found this restaurant after a long day of sightseeing, and didn't have a reservation. The owner was so kind to accommodate us and find a table for our family. The burgers were some of the best I've ever had! Other dishes we enjoyed--including dessert--were just as good. A great choice for Americans and families with picky eaters."
112,"Burgers is huge!! The best we try was House burger with extra cheese, onion and extra spicy chilli papers"
113,"Il Etait Un Square has been added to my top 5 global burger list (no particular order) - others include Little Camas Inn (Mountain Hope, Idaho USA), Geflipt (Amsterdam, NL) and Ikeda's California Country Market (Auburn, CA USA). My burger was Le Bleu (my favorite cheese on a burger is blue cheese). My wife very much enjoyed her tartare; while my son devoured his Le Hamburger oeuf a cheval. While I consider French cuisine the best globally, an outstanding hamburger is hard to beat for lunch."
114,"We never eat burgers in restaurants, it feels like waste of money. But this place makes an exception. Great burgers for a good price. Really friendly staff aswell. But definitely recommend!"
115,"I have to say, I enjoyed every single bite of the meal. I had hamburger with a beer. Considering the quality, the price is reasonable. Ideal for those who want quality and quantity of the meals."
116,We were welcomed by very friendly and enthusiastic hosts as one of them explained the menu. The food was flavourful and every bite was worth it. Such a great gem around the neighbourhood. We will definitely be going back :)
117,Have been coming here for few years now and this place is just unbeatable.  They serve one of the best cheese burgers in the world & point à la ligne. The steak tartare is out of this world a must try...  The success story behind il Etait Un Square are the staff and the owners.  Love love love will be back soon.
118,"We ended up going to the restaurant and picking up our order. The burgers and chips were still absolutely delicious when we got back to our flat. The burgers were well made with good quality ingredients, the chips were really good !! Plus which the staff were so friendly. I really recommend !"
119,"We came here last minute, we were pleasantly surprised. We knew the food would be good because we'd seen the reviews, but we didn't know it would be this amazing! We had the best burger & chips we have ever tasted and would reccommend this to anyone visiting Paris! The service was great too."
120,"I don't have much to say about this restaurant that hasn't been said here before. Everybody on this website writes how amazing it is, and you can indeed find really excellent burgers here, with delicate flavours that you usually do not find in a burger. I took the chocolate mousse for dessert, which was fine. Very quick and friendly, attentive service. Not sure this is the best restaurant in Paris, despite its ranking, but this is certainly one of the best for this range of prices, and unquestionably the best burger I've ever eaten in Paris. Therefore I highly recommend it."
121,"Me and my partner found this restaurant after search on tripadvisor. It met our expectations and more!! We reserved a table and were greeted by such lovely and attentive members of staff. The food came out fast after being seated. This was perhaps the best burger we have both eaten, everything was cooked to perfection and the homemade mayonnaise was delicious. Would definitely recommend to anyone who was visiting Paris!!"
122,"We found this restaurant at trip Advisor. Burger was absolutely delicious, one of the best I’ve had. Very recommended"
123,"We found this restaurant in an effort to get to know the Buttes aux Cailles neighbourhood better on our short weekend trip away post lockdown. And it was a great find! The restaurant is known for unique burgers and tartars. The food is delicious, the pitchers of wine are very well chosen, and the server really enjoys his job. The tiramisu was amazing!"
124,"Burger was absolutely delicious, one of the best I’ve had, however it felt very rushed, we arrived just as they opened and asked for a table for 2, we were asked had we booked, we said we hadn’t, the waiter then proceeded to look round the empty room full of empty tables to try and find us one, he said it should be ok. They also have a great offer on the website and in the window, burger, fries, drink and desert for €20, this however is take out only. As previously mentioned can not fault the burger and it is worthy of 5stars but not the overall experience."
125,"A really great burger, not too fatty either. The service was very attentive. A bit far maybe but definitely worth it. I’ll be back."
126,Good servic. Good food. Nice place. Me and my friend Very proudly.price is normalfor paris. Highly recommended.
127,"I've known about this restaurant for ages, especially as it is so highly rated on trip advisor, but only found it recently.  Originally we had planned to get take away, but since it was quiet we decided to eat in. We ate on the terrace because indoor eating was still forbidden at the time, there was a bit of wind, but we managed.  Service was wonderful, the owner or the manager at least was friendly and helpful and stayed chatting with us. He ensured we had a great meal.  Meanwhile the burgers are excellent, the quality of the ingredients is really there and they were prepared perfectly. We tried the cheddar burger and the blue burger and both were just want we wanted.  This restaurant lives up to the hype."
128,"I love burger and I think, this is the best burger that i have eaten. The services is good. , I recommended going this place."
129,"We had eaten at two other burger places prior to finding this location during our two weeks in Paris. The servers were beyond friendly and (I'm assuming) the owner came over to our table and provided some humorous banter prior to the meal. The burgers were not made of your typical ground meat...it was more like ground steak. We asked for well done and recieved a perfectly cooked burger. The fries and salad that came with the burger were also very good. They also provide ketchup and mustard for each of the tables. The prices weren't bit weren't expensive either. We paid around 50 euro for two burger plates, wine, water, and dessert. The dessert was good as well. I had the apple crumble and the wife had the chocolate mousse. All in all one of the best meals we had in Paris."
130,In this month I was go in restaurants with our friends really the restaurant was very good and neat clean the dishes of the restaurant is also good
131,Highly recommended !  Heard about this place online before we can to Paris so we Pre booked a table. Rocked up to a quiet restaurant thinking we had got the wrong place. Amazing customer service in the mean time. Sat down and not 5 minutes later the restaurant was heaving.  The burger was incredible with blue cheese and caramelised onions ooozing out of the side of the bun (and I hate onions) didn’t want it to end!  Great job guys and thanks for speaking English for us unintelligent British folk
132,"Friendly service, they made a table available to us even without a reservation on the weekend, and burgers were really delicious!! English menus available, too!"
133,"My wife and I came to Il Etait Un Square based on TA reviews and once again were treated to a gastronomic delight. This is on the surface just a burger joint, but that couldn't be further from what you get. The burgers are just incredible and cooked to perfection, in a manner you wont find anywhere else. They also specialise in steak tartare and the flavours are the heroes in the restaurant. The service is fantastic and all plates are very well priced. All in all, if you eat in Il Etait Un Square, you will leave happy."
134,"Great burgers, service was fantastic too. Reasonable prices for the quality of food. Highly recommend. Got tiramisu as dessert, it was ok. None the less fantastic place for food."
135,"Very good burgers. Some of the best I’ve had, including those from top places in New York. Deserts were great too."
136,"We made a reservation here before we got the train back to London - I would definitely recommend making a reservation!  We got seated quickly and the waiter gave us a good explanation of the menu. We both went for burgers (the cheddar and the french) and they were delicious! the burgers are reasonably priced, especially for such a big portion! The staff were very friendly too.  A great little spot for lunch or dinner - would definitely recommend!"
137,"A very nice restaurant with great burger. The owner makes you feel at home, very welcoming staff. Don't expect a romantic place..."
138,"We arrived at Il Etait Un Square expected big things after reading the reviews and we weren't disappointed. We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday and were told politely by the manager that they were very busy so there would unfortunately be a wait (it was a Saturday with school holidays looming, so it was understandable). He was very honest with us & said he did not know how long the wait would be. We decided that we wanted to try the burgers, so went to sit in the nearby park. We returned after 30mins and were pleased to find that they had tables free. The wait staff were very polite to us and spoke good English; they were very welcoming. Our food was prompt and cooked to order (I had the Parisian whilst my girlfriend had the Max). The burgers were large, were clearly handmade and most importantly were well worth the wait. On our way out the manager told us he was very happy to have been able to seat us & this made us feel very good indeed. I would definitely recommend coming here, even if you do have to wait a little bit."
139,"Comming from Colombia, where a standard burguer is of high quality, good grass-fed meat, I must say that this restaurant lives up to the expectarions . The taste is amazing, delicious sauces and formulas that keep the the core burguer concept with a smooth french cheese twist. The apple crumble is a must!"
140,"Great food and service ! Definitely recommend, very filling meal for great price ! Burger and all sauces and fillings are delicious !"
141,"They have amazing burgers with homemade, locally sourced ingredients. You will have a lovely experience, with great food and top service. The owner/manager is a great man who always makes you feel welcome! Come in --> be happy"
142,"This place is just amazing. Everything is home made, the burgers are very interesting and all have a personal, special twist on the recipes. Very affordable. The staff is super nice. Nothing negative to say, enjoyable dinner, fine atmosphere, good prices, excelent food. Will certantly come again."
143,"this has got to be my fav place to eat they make you feel very welcome had the cheddar burger it was mouth watering,the service is fab just love it would highly recommend"
144,"Yummy ... Everything is delicious. I like this place, it one of my favorite. I like their burger very yummy. Recommended"
145,"What a great place with great atmosphere and amazing food! :-) The staff are kind, polite and speak portuguese which makes a such difference! Second time there and still amazing! The keep the quality associated to the meat origine, the kitchen and the cleaness! The know how to cook a la perfection!"
146,"Last day in Europe and was glad to have come here for a great atmosphere, and most of all, good honest food. Perfect way to end my experience, as most of my traveling this trip were business related, this is one of the three restaurants worth leaving a review. Take the trek and enjoy."
147,New favorite restaurant. Amazing Cheddar burger. Excellent desert. Wonderful atmosphere and great staff.
148,Best burger I had in Europe. Wife was pregnant so she couldn't try the tartare. But both were great!
149,"you will not be disappointed. take a 3 mile cab ride from centre paris and you will find this gem. the burgers are amazing and personnel made you feel welcomed, provided recommendations — a great time!"
150,"Delicious burgers. Great customer service. If you are in Paris, make sure you pop in. Extremely easy to get to; metro stop 2 minutes away. We’ll definitely be back. Les australiens de l’ouest"
151,Service and food was impeccable. Was efficient but not rushed. Loves the welcome and the food. Would definitely go again
152,Me and my wife visited last December for our wedding ceremony and we loved it so much as of testy food and well behavior of the stuff. We enjoyed every moment there.
153,"Well illuminated and cosy restaurant with an amazing staff! The food is just on point! If you're in Paris do your best to go here either with friends, family or your loved one!"
154,"Me and my partner went here tonight, amazing food, nice location and the staff were very friendly. 100% recommend this place."
155,Visited il Etait un square after several recommendations. We were not disappointed! The tastiest burger I’ve had in a long time! (Blue burger) and the desserts were amazing too. A couple of members of the group said the apple crumble was the best they’d ever had. Friendly staff and good service. If you’re visiting Paris you’d be silly to miss this place.
156,"My partner and I went for a meal this evening and it was absolutely fantastic.  The staff were all extremely welcoming from the moment that we walked in, talking us through the menu and getting us settled.  I'd read that the burgers were fantastic from other reviews so I ordered the cheddar burger and my partner order the cajun burger. Both tasted awesome. You can tell the produce is really high quality and it just melted in the mouth. Easily the best burgers we have both ever had.  The service throughout was really friendly and I wouldn't think twice about coming back if I am ever in Paris again."
157,This is a must stop place in Paris. Me and my fiancé had the cheddar burgers and as a chef myself I must say it was nothing less that greatness. Reasonably priced as well.
158,It was very fantastic and amazing .. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food and the staff very helpful
159,"Had a wonderful time eating there. The burgers did not dissapoint. It was a generously sized burger that simultaneously left you full and longing for more! Can easily recommend. Cheers, From visiting Mauritians."
160,This place has hands down the best burgers my boyfriend or I have ever had. It’s also very close to the metro. Get the everything burger with the BBQ sauce and jalapeños. You won’t regret it.
161,Had a lovely lunch at Il Etait Un Square. The waitstaff and the host were both increibly kind. The host took time to tell us about the menu and highlight some of the things he thought we would like. The food was simply stupendous. Utterly flavorful and completely delicious.
162,"The decision was easy to make: We've seen the pictures of the burgers and immediately knew, that we have to try this place. We got what we've expected and even more. The staff is very friendly, kind and helpful. They speak good English which is always great! The service was fast and we've received the right amount of attention. We went especially for the burgers, but there is a lot more to discover. We almost got uncertain what to order when we saw the plates of others and read through the menu. It's a pity we have only one stomach... :) But we remained with our original plan and went for the burgers which we didn't regret. They were just as juicy and cheesy as on the pictures. Delicious stuff, so thumbs up!  Oh, and as we were chatting, we didn't realize that we were already past closing time. It wasn't intentional, we just completely forgot about time. We were surprized that no one came to our table to say that it's time to leave. That was very kind of them :)  So all in all, we highly recommend it to anyone. Just make sure you make a reservation because the place is busy ;)  Thank you for having us! All the best!  Dora and Peter from Budapest"
163,Best burger in town. This is a second time having lunch here and really enjoy. The staffs are very nice. definitely come back
164,"Some of the best hamburgers you'll find in Paris. The boss was warm and easy going, always asking what we thought about the food! The vegetarian option is good with a falafel replacing the meat and the apple crumble is to die for !!!"
165,"Every time I am in Paris I make sure to stop by at Il Etait Un Square. To be honest, I find reasons why I need to go to Paris just to eat the burgers.... :) Lovely staff, unbelievable food, just my favourite place in all of Paris! Love it."
166,"Best hamburguer ever, the cheese, the bread, the meat, the place, the waiter everything was awesome! You hace to go when visiting Paris. Don't forget to book a table."
167,We had a great lunch here after visiting the Catacombs. The burgers were delicious and perfectly cooked. The owner and staff were so friendly. We would definitely return when next in Paris!
168,"My husband and I are in Paris for the first time and use Trip Advisor to assist with great places to eat. We saw the ratings and decided to make our way to the neighborhood and wow—the burgers are AMAZING! So well prepared and a must try—-friendly staff, nice service and a very cozy atmosphere. You won’t be disappointed (if going for dinner-make reservations)."
169,"Came to this place randomly, best steak i've ever had in my life! The service was great, really loved it!!"
170,This place with amazing homemade burgers reminds me our bbq as childhood. If you are in Paris visit this place.
171,We didn’t have a reservation and the owner was very friendly and gave us a table anyway. The owner greeted every table personally. The food was perfect. The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Will be coming back tomorrow!
172,"San Francisco natives. Suffice it to say we get to eat some of the best foods in the world but these cheddar burgers are in a unique class of their own. They really put the majority of burgers in the US to shame! The creaminess... Is extraordinary! I'm sad I have to go back to eating normal single slice cheese burgers now. And the owner is so friendly!!! Great atmosphere, great customer service, great food. Go here. You won't be sorry!"
173,"This is not only the best burger in Paris, it’s the best burger I’ve ever had anywhere! It’s difficult to get to, but definitely worth the effort. Luscious, large patty on a brioche bun, drizzled with the cheese of your choice!! This is a 5-napkin burger! And the owner and staff are delightful......and did I mention the fries are awesome as well?! This is not to be missed!! We took Uber there, then walked to the Pantheon......definitely worth stopping by on your way and you can walk off the calories!"
174,We ate lunch here on our trip to Paris. Small quaint cafe-style place with very friendly staff. Owner came over to our table and talked to us for 10 to 15 minutes. Burgers were out of this world good and all food served fast and piping hot.
175,We'd heard about this place from Trip Advisor and decided to go and try it. The quality of the cheeseburgers were fantastic. So good. We fully recommend and definitely will back on our next trip.
176,"If you really want to eat good burgers, go to this place. Hands down the best burger I ever had in my life! We got to this place around noon, the place was packed but we were seated quickly. It has a nice French atmosphere, but not tourists-french. The menu is simple, with a nice burger selection at really good prices. All the burgers comes with small salad and fries. They are VERY generous with the toppings, and the mayonnaise sauce on the side is heaven! So if you want to eat the best burger in the world (yes, world!) go there, you will not regret it! The staff was really friendly, and if you don't speak french they have an english menu :)  I would definitely go there again! I'm really happy we've found this place."
177,"My apologies to John Catucci for plagiarizing the title of his TV show, but . . .  I have to admit I was skeptical when my wife told me a burger joint was Trip Advisor rated as the #2 restaurant in Paris out of over 16,000. But, after 2 1/2 weeks in Italy, I was craving a burger.  It was almost around the corner from where we were staying, and even though the reviews recommended reservations, we decided to take a chance and just showed up. They found us a table for 5, and the staff were friendly, courteous, outgoing and professional. Burgers, fries and beer were ordered all around, and were quickly served.  And what burgers! Big, juicy, tasty and dripping with their own cheese sauce. Amazing! I can't remember when I have enjoyed a burger more. Not even my own homemade burger stand up to these. Served as you like, but recommended medium rare, these are burgers to remember.  In Paris? Like burgers? You Gotta Eat Here!"
178,I'd heard about this place and decided to try it. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the cheeseburgers. So good. Will go back again.
179,"I had the burger of the month (obviously rotates) and my wife had The Cheddar. Our burgers were cooked perfectly cooked and I'd be hard pressed to find a burger I've enjoyed more. The beef was cooked to perfection, veggies were crisp and fresh, bun was fresh from the bakery and the perfect mix of soft and crisp. And the cheese sauce...was out of this world. I'd like to add the fries were perfect and thr atmosphere was incredible but that would just be taking away from the burger which is the real show stealer. If you're in Paris, this place is a must hit!"
180,"Its incredible to think that this Restaurant is ranked #2 (by travellers like us) of the 16,500 restaurants in Paris!! And one can get a menu (in English), which describe the relatively inexpensive burgers, including simply amazing vegetarian ""felafel (a ""Mediterranean""/middle eastern favourite) burgers... The meat [probably from French Charolais beef] is superb... and Customers are even asked by the very helpful staff how they would like the burger cooked! The sauces available are also outstanding... and the cheeses [should one desire this added extra] reflect the incredible quality and taste of highly reputed ""french cheeses""! Not to be ignored are the excellent ""french fries"" and the high quality freshly baked buns. Imagine... this restaurant is much more highly ranked than the myriad of restaurants serving very expensive ""French Food""! It is very advisable to make a reservation in advance, This restaurant will not only be ""most memorable""-- but will result in comparing these burgers with other places proving burgers.  I hope that this Review is helpful."
181,The tartare was absolutely amazing. Definitely would come back again to try the burger. Friendly staff too!
182,This place blew us away. Hands down the best burgers we’ve ever had. The meat was high quality and perfectly cooked and the cheese sauces are amazing. MUST TRY
183,"Had the best burger of my life here, had 2 in fact. They were just that delicious. Would recommend everytime."
184,Went here based on the high reviews on TripAdvisor and it didnt disappoint. The food was amazing and the service was the best we experienced in all of Paris. Thank you for a great meal!!
185,"tried to reserve online, didn’t work so went there at 19.00, when restaurant opens and got lucky. owner is friendly and explains to every table their concept and we were not dissapointed. first time someone asks me how i want my burger cooked and first thing that came up to me was “saignant”. my partner asked for “a point” and warned me about my request.. i indeed regretted my choice but the cook did prepare what i asked for. the taste was still very good, would recommend it to everybody but please don’t ask your burger to be cooked “saignant” unless you like your burger to be like “americain” ;-)"
186,Outstanding tour. Very thorough and guide was great. Tej was our guide and his knowledge of the region and WWII was accurate and informative. I also enjoyed his sense of humor and willingness to share personal stories. A day well spent
187,"Came here for our first lunch in Paris. Very friendly staff, food was tasty and reasonably priced, good start to the trip!"
188,"We came here on our first night in Paris after making a last minute reservation, and we were pleasantly surprised. We knew the food would be good because we'd seen the reviews, but we didn't know it would be this amazing! I had the best burger & chips I have ever tasted and would reccommend this to anyone visiting Paris! The service was great too."
189,"We went on a whim without a reservation. (I would recommend making a reservation). This restaurant and their staff was the best. The burger was amazing. Cooked to perfection, topped with unbelievable mixture of cheese, other meat and seasonings. The chicken ""burger"" was less perfect only because of the meat - not the toppings. But since this is a burger/beef place, stick to to beef. What set us over the top was the hospitality. We walked into a full night and the owner or manager went out of their was to accommodate us. Amazing experience and would go back again and again to keep trying new things."
190,I tried the burger of month and it worthed every single steped I walked toward there. Try they beer and catchup. It is handmade and perfect.
191,"We arrived at 20:45,they close at 21:30 and we still got a warm welcome.Although it was late but the restaurant was full,and we waited 38-45 mins for our meal(It was worth the wait) We ordered (THE MAX) burger,which I highly recommend. Reasonable price."
192,"Very cool restaurant, modern and tasty. Good burgers in homemade quality and fair prices. Very nice staff."
193,It's a good burger. The fries are good. The staff is friendly. Would I go out of my way to come back again? Doubt it.
194,This amasing place is also a good restaurant for tartare and burger lovers. Try it and you won't be desapointed
195,We came here based off the TA reviews and ot also being close to our hotel so glad we did. Like others found we couldn't book online so turned up without a booking early and managed to grab a table. The service was fabulous and the owner came out several times to check everything was ok so a super nice touch. Drinks were reasonably priced and plenty of options. I had the Parisian whichcame with ham and melted cheese - divine. Hubbie had the Cheddar and couldn't fault it. We loved this place and would definitely reccomend.
196,The best burger I've ever had - freshly prepared with fine ingredients. Fabulous location and very friendly staff. How it should be.
197,"We were in the neighbourhood and decided to give this place a try. So glad we did. Being Canadian we have had our share of burgers, but honestly, these are perhaps the best any of us have ever had. The service is very friendly too. Highly recommended if you are in Paris!  Note the online booking system is and will remain down as they are just too busy. Best to call to reserve a table or show up early."
198,We are happy with the experience here. It gives me an aftertaste of a more meaningful trip.I hope will comeback then in the future. Wish you have a great experience when you come here.
199,Until the 26th. Luckily we were only staying 300m away and ended up in the Italian across the square.
200,Out with friends and Wow!!!! Burgers that are really burgers!!! Freshly done with fresh vegetables in it and freshly cooked fries to match it up with. Yummy! Great place to hang out with friends as well.
201,We booked online based on the reviews and we were welcomed and offered a range of tables. The waiter went through the whole menu and was fantastic. It was a very hot day 42c and they had some cooking spray for each table to help manage. The food was out of this world and very reasonable €16 for an incredible burger and fries. Superb!
202,"The reviews are the real deal. We visited many restaurants in Paris, many were good but this was a great experience. The most friendly staff/owner and quick service sets it apart from anywhere else. The Parisian and Max burgers were both delicious... tasted quality beef and needed to eat with a fork and knife due to all the cheese. No doubt why it is now the #1. Thank you for a wonderful evening."
203,"Great place Great burger , fresh and well prepared tasty and well executed Great people Would visit again and again..."
204,"We visited here based on the great reviews and it did not disappoint! We had a cheese platter for starter, which was lovely and different burgers for mains. The melted cheese sauce on their burgers is so tasty and the unique meat they use is cooked to perfection and delicious. There is a nice range of french beers and wines on offer as well, which is what everyone wants to see at a good restaurant. A special mention to the staff here who take great care of their customers, including fans of Marcelo Bielsa :-D"
205,"We had the amazingly well made stake tartare and after some delicious burgers with chips and a salad. The service was excellent and the staff was very welcoming, had a really great time."
206,Best Burgers we had in a while! The starters (sliced bread with a bluecheese/bacon/onion cream) and also the dessert (warm applecrumple) were delicious too! Also the hosts / waiters were really nice and friendly! Definitely a redo when we are back in Paris :)
207,"Came to Paris for a getaway from the usual. Found this place and will definitely be returning. The burgers were very good and even had the chance to meet the owner, very humble!"
208,Burgers were very good. Waiters are very friendly and helpful. They speak English too! Great place for a delicious dinner. Affordable prices and worth the money!
209,"After seeing this restaurant was ranked #1 on TA we were pleased to secure a booking the same evening via our hotel concierge.  The establishment is out of the way of the centre of Paris, it took us 30 mins via Uber from the Opera area. We were a little late due to traffic but were seated straight away. The place is not pretentious in any way, there is a relaxed vibe evident in the decor and diners.  We had a nice introduction from the very friendly owner/manager who talked us through the different menu items and pointed out some photos.  On to the food - the burgers are really nice with the speciality cream of cheese. The buns complement this. The fries are really nice too. The owner also seemed genuinely interested to know whether we enjoyed our food which was good.  Despite the above, and not to the detriment of Il Etait Un Square in any way but I am not clear why this is ranked the best place in town (unless there is a particularly high number of burger connoisseurs visiting Paris maybe)! My burger was nice, but I won’t remember it for long.  In short - if I was in the vicinity then I would definitely come back, but I’m not sure I would head all the way across the city."
210,Ordered the blue cheese burger with fries. Really excellent burger and large portion of fries. Very nice staff who treated us well. Would definitely go back and try other options as well.
211,"We did not have a reservation, but the owner was able to fit us in which we greatly appreciated! The burgers were so good. They definitely had a unique selection of different burgers to choose from. Our favorites were the Bleu Burger and the Max Burger. You can’t go wrong though. Very quaint,charming, and friendly place. It did not disappoint!"
212,Don’t miss out on this awesome restaurant in Paris! This Texas family approves this burger spot! Best burger ever and best service too!
213,"Cannot fault as to why this establishment got the number 1 spot in Paris on TA! Well deserving of the spot. The food is amazing and so is the service! It’s quite out of the way of Central Paris but worth travelling down to for their food. The owner has so much passion for their food that he thoroughly explained the menu when we got our table. The food was exquisite and they also provided us a can of mist to cool ourselves down as it was a really hot day in France, even in the evening. That was an extremely gracious touch on their service. Will definitely go here again with my family next time!"
214,"The beef is slightly different from that found in USA, the cheese is a lot different and the bread is delicious (not ""just a roll""). Overall, the burgers offer a new and seemingly better tasting twist on American burgers (even expensive burgers in foodie havens in NYC). The staff is very friendly and helpful, the price is very reasonable, the food is delicious, and the place is spotless. A great spot to try a ""French burger"" in Paris (also offers steak tartare burgers if interested- too odd a concept for me)."
215,Wow. Can’t fault this restaurant at all. We came late on Thursday evening without booking and they managed to squeeze us in at short notice. The burger was unbelievable and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the pesto ravioli too. Lovely service and the prices were very reasonable. Thank you.
216,The burgers were amazing! The owner was really nice and enthusiastically explained the menu. We really enjoyed this meal - highly recommended!!
217,Really nice place with extra tasty burgers! Recomend for families with children. Friendly waitresses and good prices

We tried the burgers ( cheddar and max ) and they were amazing! Very light, juicy, meat and bread was fresh. The girl who served us was very polite and professional and speaks english very good ( you won’t find that in France very often ). I would go there again for sure! Thank you!"
219,The burgers were delicious. We ordered the Max and the Cheddar. Both were yummy. The servers provided an menu in english and also gave a brief overview of the offerings. We enjoyed our lunch very much!
220,Good quality burgers with a french touch. Fast service with customer attention and lot of varieties of burgers even with vegetarian version. Nice place with easy access and good quality price balance
221,"Delicious food. Bun was light, high quality meat on the burger. Cheddar was like a cheese whiz but really tasty. Killer fresh cut fries. Very personable owner. I get why their rating is so high!"
222,"Went here for lunch after reading good reviews and definitely didn't disappoint. The quality of service, food and all round atmosphere were excellent. Location is in a quiet area but not far from all the tourist attractions of Paris. When we arrived we were seated straight away and the waiter explained the menu to us and told us about each burger and steak etc on the menu. The food arrived quick and was of amazing quality and the 3 mini desserts and coffee were also amazing. All for a reasonable price aswell. A must visit if you're in Paris!!!"
223,"We traveled on the metro to this place and were so delighted with the location and neighborhood. Very charming restaurant, great service, and wonderful food. Staff were informative and spoke English well. It didn’t disappoint!! Worth the trip!"
224,"It’s our anniversary and I wanted a place my burger- loving husband would enjoy. This hit the spot. Thank you once again to Trip Advisor and all the travelers who came here before me. Easy to get to on the Metro. Charming neighborhood. Wonderful wait staff. They are kind and welcoming. Happy to explain the entire menu. I had told my husband we could go to Five Guys once while in Paris. After eating here, my husband said we could skip Five Guys and come back here. Yea! All of their food looks and sounds wonderful. I know my husband will go for a burger next time but I might try something else. I’m sure it will be wonderful!"
