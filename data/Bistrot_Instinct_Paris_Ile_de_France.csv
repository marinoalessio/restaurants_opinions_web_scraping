0,My husband and I enjoyed with small restaurant immensely. The food was delicious and the service friendly.
1,Everything was delicious. We went there for lunch without a reservation. They were very accommodating and found us a table. I would definitely have a reservation next time. I highly recommend this restaurant.
2,"I was privileged to eat dinner here after the amazing concierge at my hotel secured me a reservation. This is the number 5 restaurant in Paris on TripAdvisor. It is a small restaurant that is almost always fully booked.  Not only did I have a table, but I was seated at the chef's table about 6 feet from the open kitchen. It was an amazing experience to watch my food and everyone else's being prepared by the chef and his assistant.  The menu is a little limited but the food that is offered is excellent. It is perfectly portioned and prepared and presented like a work of art. So much attention to detail. I was at the restaurant for almost 2 hours with an unobstructed view of the kitchen. Every plate that I saw was prepared the same. It's as close as perfection as a human can get.  When I asked to substitute the mashed potatoes that accompany the turbot (fish), the waiter and chef said no problem. Not all Paris restaurants allow substitutions. They replaced it with mashed carrots.  Just like the food, the service was excellent. The menu had an English translation. Waiter was fluent or near-fluent in English, which is seldom the case in Paris. The overall vibe is a little more casual. Paper napkins, casual clothes, no tablecloths. It's not your stereotypical upscale Parisian bistro or cafe. But the service was just as good with the facade that often comes with fine dining.  The wine list was extensive but a little expensive. I stuck to the chablis offered by the glass.  All things considered, Bistrot Instinct was excellent. I can see why it is number five on TripAdvisor. Not only would I return, but I would highly recommend it."
3,"We enjoyed a 3 course meal with nice accompanying wines. For a michelin star restaurant the sizes of the courses were about larger than we are normally used to, but nothing to complain as it was lovely. Would definitely recommend"
4,"We now know why this restaurant is so well rated. The welcome was warm and even though we were a few minutes early for our noon reservation, we were invited in and seated. The food was fantastic and we enjoyed watching the activity in the kitchen from our upstairs perch. Our mushroom starter, our pollack main and creme brûlée dessert were imaginatively plated and tasted as good as they looked. Next trip to Paris, this restaurant will be in our “must visit” list."
5,"We chose to return a week after our initial visit because it had been so wonderful. We mistakenly believed that we had a reservation through our server, but it turned out that despite receiving a sizable tip, she had not done so. As a result, there was nowhere for us to sit outside, and we opted not to sit in a stuffy, crowded restaurant."
6,"One of the best The food is tasty and unique, All the Dishes are very good looking excellent service"
7,Great food and solicitous servers made this a great lunch. We wish them continued success. It was a delicious spot at the top of the Marais.
8,"My wife, daughter and I chose this restaurant for our first night in Paris based on the great TripAdvisor reviews. We had a very enjoyable meal. The food was very tasty and creative, the service was excellent with each dish described in detail, and the prices made the whole experience one of rare value. We would definitely recommend."
9,"Wow wow wow! A small, cozy bistro with really polite and friendly hosts, and AMAZING food! Will be coming back here many times."
10,The food was amazing with each dish so beautifully prepared and explained by the brilliant staff. The restaurant is small and we had the benefit of overlooking the kitchen so we could see the care and attention the team were giving to our meal.
11,"A really wonderful experience at Bistrot Instinct. Dinner and wine choices, and service throughout, exceptional. Several choices made by group and all superb, including wine, appetizers and desserts. Cozy ambience inside; likewise, a nice area in the 3rd, near Place de Republique and Temple."
12,Truly worth going out of your way for. Every dish sublime - from the blended pate to the perfect beef tataki to the roasted figs dessert. Service friendly and impeccable. Will definitely return.
13,"Found restaurant on TripAdvisor. Located in Le Marais near Republic metro. Warm welcome, lovely modern restaurant with fantastic waiters. This isn't just dinner, it's a dining experience! Offered choice of tables, we were upstairs with view of open kitchen- amazing! Had delicious cocktails to start, shared a houmous dish served with the freshest bread. Veal rump for the main with artichoke served 2 ways- you have to try it! Dessert was blood orange pavlova with meringue & cream and sorbet. Wine was available both by bottle or glass. We paired the main with a Côte de Rhône, 100% syrah. Whole experience cost less than €150, which was amazing value for such a fabulous experience!"
14,"Totally wonderful dining experience! So much more than just dinner. Shown upstairs on arrival and allowed to pick our table. We selected one with a view of the open kitchen. Fabulous cocktails to start with. Then the houmous starter and the veal rump for main. Food was incredible. Also, the waiters interact with just the right amount to explain the dishes composition. Finished off with the blood orange Pavlova and a Calvados! Vibrant but lovely ambiance makes this place one of the best experiences we've ever had. Bravo!"
15,Wonderful dinner with knowledgeable and friendly server Lou! Explained the menu in detail and each dish was very well presented and tasty. Shared hummus and had the vegetarian and fish mains. Very delicious! Accommodated mobility issues by seating us on ground floor and called for taxi to take us back to hotel. Highly recommend eating here.
16,Welcoming staff fluent in English. Fair wine prices. Haute cuisine at reasonable prices. Comfortable tables upstairs.
17,We had wonderful food and great service at Bistrot Instinct! Our server described every dish in great detail and recommended great wine. The staff called a taxi for us and let us know when it had arrived. Everyone was very accommodating.
18,We absolutely LOVED our dinner here tonight. We had the most amazing service (we didn’t catch our waiters name but he was amazing). He explained every dish as it was placed infront of us. He even knew the background of the wine we chose. Our tastebuds were genuinely sparkling during our meal here. We loved the fish entree and veal main. 2x MUST have dishes when you visit. 11/10 would recommend & we would love to come back next time we visit Paris. Thank you for a wonderful evening :)
19,"Cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and - welcoming and kind service - all at a reasonable price point. What more could you ask for? Our server, Simon, was super nice as he explained the menu and wine options to us. Highly recommend - reservations needed as it’s a small place."
20,The saithe fish fillet was melt in your mouth to die for stupendous. Corn soup with chorizo also TOP
21,The best service and food on out trip to Paris. One of the owners was serving and the otherone was in the kitchen. Can recomend it warmly to anyone.
22,"What a wonderful little bistro this is! All of the family were very happy with their meals and the service was also very welcoming and professional.  If you look for fresh ingredients, beautifully presented food that is healthy and nutritious, I would most certainly recommend Bistro Instinct."
23,"Delicious, tastly and healthy in house food we really enjoyed for our lunch today! We had the fish and the veggie dishes. Try them!  This is the place you wanna go if you wish to eat French dishes by a young and skilled team. And you ll be surprised by the very economic bill at the end of your meal ."
24,"Everything was great from the service to the food, really worth to stop by this restaurant if you are around Marais quartier"
25,"An absolutely amazing meal, with both wonderful food and service. Bottom line, you need to come here when you are in Paris. You will not regret it."
26,"Delicious, not touristy, intimate dining experience. Went here for my birthday. I had the vegetarian dish - I am not even vegetarian but it was delicious. The cocktails and wine are also excellent. The menu was very unique, a fusion of traditional French and some Japanese ingredients"
27,"So happy we found this little gem of a restaurant! After looking over the menu, we asked what they recommended and every item we received was delicious!! It was small & quaint and by sitting upstairs we had a great view of the kitchen and could watch the meals being prepped & prepared. My husband and I recommended this spot to several people we met while in Paris and also to family who were planning a trip to Paris this summer. We would definitely go back if in the area again."
28,"Top food and top service. The plates where creative, very well executed and explained in detail. A great meal! Highly recommend"
29,A very cozy french bistro. The service was superb. The food excellent (maybe here i ate the most tender beef in my entire life). They also prepared for our kids a wonderful plate especially for them (well grilled chicken with potato puree) Maybe of the extreme high quality of food i was a little bit disappointed with the desserts (especially pavlova). That's why i don't give 5 stars
30,"i hate to think that my review would contribute to raising the profile and popularity of this place - i'd rather keep this gem of a gourmet dining a secret. But praise where it's due, and i have nothing but praise for this restaurant. Service, ambiance, quality and flavour and presentation of food - everything was faultless and exciting.  Bravo!"
31,Wonderful food Fantastic Service Excellent value for money Make sure you make a reservation otherwise you will miss out
32,"Unfortunately I think that this restaurant was better in the past. Even the pictures on TA look better than our experience. Dont get me wrong, it is not bad, but the best part of the evening was the service. Mackerel and liver, both dishes too dry. Veal was good, salad too. Nice wine list at decent prices. Desserts ok, not special. Vibe is really nice, but at first it is about the food. No disappointment, just not great."
33,What a fantastic restaurant! The staff were beyond amazing and the food one of the best we've ever had. I understand the Michelin star! The price is extremely fair for the quality. 10/10 would recommend.
34,"Fantastic Food & service. All you could ask for, we really loved the concept small place and the straff was like a family."
35,"We both had drinks, a starter, main course and dessert. We can only echo the other reviews. This was a most wonderful experience. The service was kind and attentative (for example our waiter asked if we want to have starters right away or wait until we have finished our drinks), and the food just a delight - the flavors, the colors, a mix to perfection. The portions also have the right size. The location has a nice ambiance, not stiff. If one has trouble climbing relatively steep stairs, we recommend reserving a table on the ground floor.  If you have the chance to dine here, don't miss it. Simply one of the bests!"
36,"The food was incredible, we each had three courses. The service was kind, attentive and informative - all round a fantastic experience. The ambiance is lovely too, and they have a great selection of drinks."
37,We loved this perfect French restaurant in a terrific area to tour around. The pork entree was fantastic. The leek soup was so good. I've been telling people about this place since and owed the very kind team at Bistrot Instinct a public thank you. Best to all!
38,"Amazing food, and compared to SF Bay Area very reasonably priced. Not only was the food outstanding but it was visually so beautiful. Would go back in a heartbeat."
39,"We went there a week ago and had a fabulous lunch at very reasonable prices especially for a Michelin star restaurant. The food was inventive, visually beautiful and delicious. We enjoyed it so much we went back 2 days later to eat there again ."
40,"Found this restaurant via TripAdvisor. This was a great found. Food was excellent, everything was so tasty. They also had very good wines and reasonably priced. Interior was quite simple but cozy. Service was perfect, so I will defenetly come here again 👍"
41,"Had a business lunch here. Place is small and intimate, food is good and innovative, service attentive and friendly.Prices fair. Nothing not to like."
42,"We had a wonderful evening at Bistrot Instinct. Good food, excellent service, in a small restaurant with a lovely ambience where you can watch the chef work. It was reasonably priced too. We had a great time and would recommend Bistrot Instinct to anyone. Thank you!"
43,"As a solo traveler, and often diner, I feel like I am a good test of whether service is truly gracious -- a single diner is not always sincerely welcomed. At Bistrot Instinct, I was treated like royalty, and the server who called a cab for me on a rainy night even went out and checked many times to see if the cab had arrived.  The food was wonderful -- I thought it was a bargain for the price -- and the room, and atmosphere, are cozy and comfortable.  A really lovely experience. Just wish I had had the foresight to make another reservation during my stay."
44,"absolutely a fantastic little spot on a vast gastronomic map of Paris. Worth travelling to. Great, personable service, excellent English . Food was fantastic - turbot, veal steak, lamb - all absolutely amazing. And bread to die for :) . Highly, highly recommended. Realizing that it is easy to get lost amongst thousands of restaurants in Paris - you will not regret visiting this Bistrot :)"
45,"fantastic food and service. Tidy and fair price. Amazing selection of wines. small and kosy place, good vibe and recomended"
46,"We were here for a special occasion with my wife - perfect place for a night out and gourmet experience in Paris. We had scallop tartare and a hummus for a starters - perfect yummy for star For the mains we ordered Veal Filet Mignon and Confit Lamb Leg - what a fantastic experience that was!!! I can only put 5 stars out of 5! Perfect, perfect, perfect *****"
47,"So glad we found this place. The coctails, wine, food and service are all outstanding. It is no wonder they have a Michelin star. The staff is very friendly and helped explain everything on the menu. It was really cool to see the chef creating the plates right in front of us. The chefs personality really shines in the food. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice intimate dinner."
48,"On our last night we found Bistrot Instinct. It was not only as good as the reviews say... it was better. The waiter, who happened to be a part owner of the restaurant was extremely knowledgeable about every single element of every dish that came out. The food was unexpectedly some of the best, if not the best we experienced while in Paris. We would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great meal accompanied by a great staff. Will definitely be back again next time we're in Paris."
49,"Extremely wonderful food, drinks, atmosphere, and staff. The menu is well curated and food expertly prepared. I will eat here every time I'm in Paris."
50,Very small and elegant restaurant. The staff is very friendly and spoke English well. The food was delicious and well portioned. Recommend 10/10
51,"Charming little jewel tucked away in the streets of Paris. Been here three times. Always charming with Impeccable flavors. It’s more than just a restaurant or bistro, it’s that feeling of visiting friends and your friend happens to be a talented chef. Don’t miss out on this one."
52,"Bistrot Instinct is a delightful little place tucked away on a quaint street. The staff is charming and friendly and make the place as cheerful and happy as any in Paris. I would wholeheartedly give this place five stars but we found the food to be a little bland and uninspired for lunch. We had the steak and potatoes and the grilled trout. It was good, but just needed a little tweaking with seasoning to make it wonderful. It's a beautiful little restaurant and I would still recommend for a casual lunch while walking the streets of Paris."
53,"Superb food. Could not have asked for a better meal. Dishes were well balanced, incredibly tasty and nice portion size for French standards. Wine list was a joy"
54,Great beef and friendly service! Would definitely return in the future. Little non pretentious gem hidden away in Marais....
55,"My husband and I dined at Bistrot Instinct on our first night in Paris - and it ultimately was the best meal of the 7 night trip.  The space is cozy and inviting. The service warm and attentive. The cocktails were yummy though admittedly not the stand out. The food was the real highlight.  We started with a corn soup that was topped with feta - it was fantastic and we finished every drop. For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my husband got the veal. As someone who is a little hit or miss on both lamb and mushrooms, I was hesitant ordering the dish but it’s a small menu and it seemed like a solid choice. It was absolutely delicious. The lamb was perfectly cooked and I loved the mushrooms and polenta combination. Totally happy with my choice. My husband also really enjoyed his veal. We ended the night with a yummy chocolate dessert - though I can’t remember the specifics likely due to cocktail consumption mentioned above.  I’d absolutely recommend Bistrot Instinct to anyone in Paris/stopping through Le Marais (though picky eaters should be aware the menu is small)."
56,"Delicious food, amazing service and fantastic ambience! I would recommend it to everyone! I will definitely come back!!"
57,"This was recommended by the concierge at our hotel . While the bistrot was simple , everything was first class from the greeting at the door to our waitress and the excellent and incredibly good- value food .  The hummus appetizer was very good and both entrees were delicious - the sea trout with lemon mashed potatoes and fennel vinegar , and the chicken with butternut squash purée and mustard .  This is a great find for lunch ."
58,"Once in a while you come across a near perfect eatery on your travels that defines your stay. This is one such place. It is tucked away in a side street, easily missed. If the outside looks inviting, well, the interior is even better. Small, cosy, perfect mix between old and modern. And so is the food. Every dish we had between the three of us, was great. From the crab, to the monkfish, from the veal to the lamb, all cooked to perfection and plated with love. This combined with a great winelist (try a bottle of organic red Roussillon, a steal for just 32€) and a really helpful and smiling staff, well what more could you wish for. This is such a nice little bistro that it is well worth your visit. As with the interior, the mix between modern and classic, is spot on. These guys know how to make you feel welcome, and how to cook a dinner with great ingredients and love."
59,"A superb little bistro tucked away in a small alley in the far side of the Marais, Bistrot Instinct provides a small menu with an exquisite experience. Everything is so delicately balanced and if you can sit in the ground floor high chairs to watch the chefs at work, you can appreciate the focus and meticulousness they put into their work. The steak was perfectly well done and their potatoes (and I don’t usually get impressed by potatoes) was the best I’ve tasted in Paris. This place is a worthwhile visit!"
60,We loved Bistrot Instinct so much we ate there twice which is saying something with so many fantastic restaurants in Paris. We had lunch one day and went back the next evening for dinner. We had fish and chicken dishes and the soup appetizer which was really fabulous. I'm still thinking about that soup! The wait staff was friendly.
61,"Lovely dinner at a charming spot. Food was not same old, same old. Excellent service. Interesting wines. Quiet enough to talk and be heard."
62,"Fantastic food, service and ambience. Staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. Standard of food was excellent. Well worth a visit!"
63,"Good cocktails, bitter beer and wonderful food. There is nothing you would like more. The service was great, food delicious. If you are into smoked things try the smoked bourbon, you won’t regret it."
64,"Went here because of the good reviews. We were definitely not disappointed. Food was great but the service was even better. Enjoyed every minute. The neighborhood around it is also very nice, recommended to go for an after-dinner-drink."
65,"Great food, atmosphere and hospitality. Very nice place where you definitely want to come back with friends and family."
66,The food was absolutely delicious and service was unexpectedly quick. We had our main course within 15 minutes and enjoyed some lovely cocktails beforehand. The waiters were also extremely friendly and attentive. I will definitely come back!
67,This is a very nice small restaurant. We shared several courses and desserts. Everything was delicious! They take credit cards.
68,"Excellent food. The “perfect egg” in smoked haddock was incredible. And the saddle of lamb… not only the meat melt in your mouth, the chickpeas with pomegranate and gravy was heavenly. The white cheese emulsion with lime sorbet and the rhubarb was a perfect finish."
69,Excellent cuisines at very fair prices makes for a tremendous valu. Our chicken and veal were impeccable
70,"Delicious entrecôte for 2 washed down with a nice rose and a light, bursting with fruit blackberry cream with meringue for afters. Ended with an unusual but crisp/refreshing liqueur called byrrh on the house. Very nice staff and ate at a table in the street due to lockdown - nice quiet street despite the odd moped whizzing through which made for a bizarre Diva-like scene at times."
71,"We opted for the lunch menu which worked out at about £20 each for two courses. My cold soup starter was delightful, whilst the main course was absolutely delicious. Portions were average sized, but the food was very tasty and the service and ambiance excellent. A wonderful place for typically French meal."
72,"Really great experience here. Such friendly staff and prompt service with attention to all the details. The menu is wonderful too. We had the cucumber hummus and the rabbit terrine to start. Both were very light, nicely presented and a perfect soft intro to the mains. For the mains we had veal chop which was juicy and delicious with a lovely combination of two sauces, plus vegetables. For the other we had the fillet of fish served on mashed potato with a sprinkling of vegetables around it and an absolutely delicious sauce over it, light and tasty. Both were utterly delicious. One of the waiters paired the veal with a lovely dry white wine too. We indulged in a dessert each and both were great - the profiterole with pistachio icecream in the middle and melted chocolate all around, and the biscuit meringue with raspberry, so nice. The atmosphere was great, the decor comfortable and the experience excellent. Really nice first meal on this Paris trip. Highly recommend. (Tip: Upstairs can get quite hot so if reserving a table it would be a good idea to request one next to the windows)."
73,We had such a lovely meal and Bistrot Instinct. The food was presented nicely and tasted even better. The service was excellent and all waiters spoke excellent English. Cannot recommend enough.
74,"We selected this restaurant based on the good scores from TripAdvisor... And it was even better than expected. The fish was full of flavor thanks to unusual and researched mix of ingredients, entrecote delicious, staff friendly and professional. I look forward to it again."
75,"We enjoyed our meal very much. We especially appreciated our server, Lou, who spoke great English, and helped us with the menu. Plus, he was attentive and eager to please. Sat outside on a cute street. Good service and good food."
76,"Quaint bistro, gave an authentic French feel. Great service & excellent English too! Cost €20/main, approx €35/bottle wine which was recommended to us. Would highly recommend for couples or small groups of friends"
77,"Simply the best. Extraordinarily delicious food, exquisite service and cosy, friendly atmosphere. A must go for any trip to Paris even if you only have a couple of nights."
78,"went here since it was number 1 on TripAdvisor. the food was good, but the reason it's getting full score is the service. when we asked for place nearby for drinks they did not just give recommendations, but also called the places to check if it was open or full."
79,"A lovely new informal contemporary bistro in the Haut Marais. The food is healthy and of great quality, with well-chosen wines available by the glass. It is good value (especially the set menu at lunchtime), and the young waiters are attentive and friendly. Decor and ambiance very agreeable too. Highly recommended within its price range."
80,"My wife and I went to Bistrot Instinct for lunch based on other TA reviews and we certainly weren't disappointed. The restaurant was busy but we were seated straight away and waited on as if we were the only ones there. The food was incredible, so fresh and tasty, and the price was very reasonable. We left with full bellies and smiles on our faces, both agreeing that we would definitely be back. I would highly recommend Bistrot Instinct to anyone."
81,"We were surprised, given the ranking of this restaurant that we were able to book a reservation only several days prior...one of the advantages of going off-season in February. It lived up to the hype. Really amazing food at incredible prices, great atmosphere, solid wine list, attentive and friendly service. Small, but on two floors and we felt very comfortable upstairs. Will be sure to return on our next visit."
82,We had a wonderful dinner here. Booking was super easy online and as the place was full the night we went I imagine not many groups get in without a booking. We were staying just around the corner and this place felt like an truly authentic French bistro. It was busy but the staff were super attentive. The menu is small but had something for everyone. The food was super tasty - French food at its best.
83,The title says it all and I had an amazing food dining with my family and friends. Small place but the service of the staff was attentive and excellant. Quite limited food selection on the menu but overall highly recommended for dinner dining.
84,"I highly recommend this restaurant a stone’s throw from La Place de la Republique. The decor is trendy, the staff very efficient and friendly (with good English if you don’t speak French) and the food is of a very high quality. The menu is not extensive, which I think is a good thing, and there is usually a couple of specials. We turned up on a Tuesday evening and it was full so I would recommend booking in advance, as it’s not a big place. We booked for the next evening and were so impressed we booked again for the following evening. The wine list is a bit pricey but the dishes are good value: about €20 for a main course and €9/€10 for starters and desserts. Bon appetit."
85,I really recommend this restaurant! The food is so delicious and the waiters were so kind. We definitely will come back..
86,"I love this place! I went there based in the previous reviews and am so glad I did. It is a little off the main attractions, but I think it is part of its charm. Not touristy, but they speak English. Amazing food! Not much option, but it is common in a neighborhood bistro. I loved the fish and appetizers I tried. I went there a few times because I loved it so much! If you want to eat like locals, go there."
87,Followed TripAdvisor to find an exemplary lunch with friends would love to to be closer to home. They have the confidence to offer a small menu at lunchtime but when the cooking is this good there is no requirement to broaden the choice. Loved it
88,"I beautiful meal, perfectly cooked and wonderfully presented, tasty and exceptional value. Definitely worth investigating and with a good bar a vin opposite. Attentive service. Best meal I had in Paris. Thank you"
89,"The best culinary experience we have had for a very long time. I ordered the veal and my partner ordered the fish of the day - both were phenomenal. The staff were kind, interesting & extremely attentive. We shall whole-heartedly be recommending the Bistrot Instinct to our friends. A must-eat if you’re in Paris."
90,Amazing little restaurant. My friends and I were looking for something small and seclusive to enjoy a quiet dinner and this place exceeded all our expectations. Really good price for a service of this quality and the food is home made. Just book in advance
91,Wow. What a find! Fabulous service. Amazing food. A little gem tucked away on a side street. Book to make sure you have a table!
92,"Wonderful experience at this quaint restaurant. The food is all homemade; its not fancy by any means but it is very well executed. Service was very good. We had the lunch menu which had very limited choices and changes daily, but what we had was very good. Prices are reasonable, expect to spend about 20-25 euro for a good lunch."
93,"If you are in Paris visit this place. This is a gem. Cozy restaurant. Great service. Fantastic food. Everything is home made. Chef Maki is very flexible, he makes adjustments with no fuss (allergies, without gluten, vegetarian), and his creations are truly spectacular. I fully recommend and will definitely be back on my next trip."
94,Super place in a very nice area of Paris Young very friendly great food Small menu but unusual food and great quality Very nice evening!
95,"Lovely atmosphere, charming staff, excellent food. Rabbit pate and vegetable tempura were great starters! Split the 60 oz. rib steak with my partner - again, excellent- not a scrap left behind! Do stop in, you won’t regret it !"
