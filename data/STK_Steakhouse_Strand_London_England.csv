0,The venue is beautiful but It wouldnt be enough without the amazing staff. Cocktails and food top quality ...... Good music and a very attentive staff giving the customer and evening to remember.
1,"We dined at the restaurant on Friday evening and had a most enjoyable time. Not only was the food excellent, but we had the delightful service of the waitress Luminata who really made the occasion with her friendly, attentive and professional service.  We absolutely loved the DJ's music vibe, which helped create a lively, but not too loud atmosphere (and we were seated quite close).  We enjoyed pre-dinner drinks, a 3-course menu and excellent cocktails to round the evening off. Delightful evening and we will be returning when we are next in town."
2,"We went for a pre-theatre dinner. The decor is nice and initially the service was good. However, as the restaurant became more busy the service was lacking. We chose the 3 course set menu and placed our order for all 3 courses, the starters came out quickly, but we were left waiting a long time for the main. The starters were nice, but the main wasn’t so good. As the service was so slow we didn’t have time to have dessert! Being a set menu they couldn’t deduct the dessert, so we asked if they would remove our drinks from the bill and they were accommodating. I’m not sure if I’d return."
3,"Given the prime location of this restaurant, I was expecting good food and good service. Disappointed on both accounts. After an initial good start with a waiter giving us some information about the food on offer and the chef's recommendation of cooking (steak), we then had to wait 45 minutes to place ur order, and only then after I had to request that our order be taken. However, while waiting I tried on several occasions to get the staff's attention, only to have the two female members of staff, make eye contact with me but continue to ignore me in favor of leaning on the DJ booth and slapping each other's backsides. Because of waiting so long to order we had to forgo getting starters and desserts so went straight for the mains. The children had the steak strips, very nice and well cooked. We had the Porterhouse 900g £113.00 to share. Very disappointing, less than 250g of meat and after all the fuss with the chef's recommendations, they didn't even cook it as requested. It came out medium of the requested medium rare, so in my opinion overdone. I had to scavenge around the bones to get a few morsels of medium-rare meat. All in all not worth the £357.19 paid and I would defiantly expect trained and respectable staff in an establishment charging those prices. Just wish we hadn't had the inforces time constraints as I would have defiantly sent the steak back. Very disappointing, but the silver lining was, lovely creamed spinach so I filled up on that."
4,"The food and service were amazing, this is our second time and the food never disappoints. Thank you to Luminita for looking after as so well and helping us when we had questions.  Will definitely be coming back soon!"
5,"Lovely drinks, perfect food, amazing service from Luminita! Great location too! Can’t wait for our next visit…"
6,"We are in London to see Harry Potter at the nearby Theatre, and were worried that we didn’t have a restaurant booking for the interval, but we managed to get in super last minute to STK, which was a relief as we had visited the Westminster STK last year and thoroughly enjoyed our experience there. Our server, Luminita, was very friendly as well as efficient in making sure that we were in and out with time to spare, whilst not feeling rushed. The food was great, and we received complimentary brioche to start. Would recommend."
7,"We were staying at the Westminster hotel London and decided to eat at steak for the last night we were in town. We were asked if we wanted water when we first was seated, this water was put on the bil for almost 6£. The steak i ordered was almost without taste and verry poor with only a couple mini potatos on the side. At the end a regular meal for 2 ended up costing 110£ for food that wasent Even good. On the pluss side it was good service and we got some free bread of some reason (but the bread wasnt good either). I would not recomend it or think about going back."
8,"Myself and 3 friends had an amazing night at STK! Great vibe , our very attentive server Dario was superb! We couldn't of ask for anything more! Anything we needed Dario was our man. Cocktails nice and strong ...received promptly, food delicious.. brilliant night had by all! Will be back for sure."
9,"Came by with colleagues, food was not that great, very average, and for the price I would expect better. Atmosphere is that of a nightclub, very loud and not the type of vibe you would expect for dining."
10,"We had dinner and celebrated a birthday for my wife, we had a splendid dinner - really enjoyed the meal, the service and the ambiance  My short rib was done perfectly, it didn’t have any fat in it, it was literally falling apart on the fork and was well balanced with the source and the creamy potatoes  The steaks my family has were done to perfection, not even a gram was left  Fabio was our waiter, he was lovely, caring, and funny  It is indeed pricy however compared to some other restaurants it’s actually worth the money  I will certainly come back"
11,"I went back to STK Steakhouse as I hadn’t been there in a while and it never fails! The food was fantastic, the staff was brilliant and made us feel really welcome, and the music was amazing and you get a real club vibe feel. I’d definitely come back to STK again and again!"
12,Was keen to try this location as have eaten at them before in the US and have always been impressed. Large restaurant area and very loud. Live DJ Friday and Saturday but fortunately not on this night. We asked to move to a slightly quieter area in the restaurant which they did. Service was friendly and excellent. Steaks were top dollar but I’m afraid didn’t justify the price. Mac n Cheese superb as was the wine. No burger option was strange and other selections if meat isn’t your thing were limited. Sadly not one to return to. London is now awash with seriously excellent steak restaurants who just do it better.
13,"Myself and 8 others were out for a friends birthday and 6 of us ordered the Oysters. The next day all 6 of us who ordered the oysters were then extremely ill - violently vomiting, shivering and in severe pain. This is absolutely unacceptable for a restaurant of this calibre and we shall never be returning. We also waited more than 2 hours for our food. Extremely disappointed."
14,"Had an absolutely appalling experience here, which was unexpected as I have had multiple good experiences dining at other branches of STK.  Firstly we were sat in the corner where it was so cold we had to retrieve our coats from the cloakroom to keep warm, bear in mind I was wearing a full long sleeve and long trousers jumpsuit so shouldn’t of been cold inside. The restaurant was very busy but when I saw an open table I asked if we could possibly move to which the staff member agreed and informed us he would prepare the table.  About 10 minutes later a different lady from the reception team with what sounded to me like an Italian accent appeared and informed us in an aggressive manner that it was not possible for us to move as they had other guests booked on that table. The music is loud so her shouting may of been understandable but her tone was point blank aggressive, she was ranting and raving to the point where I had to interrupt her to ask her if I could speak. She agreed it was cold and told us she too was cold as she had to stand there all day (shouting at me as though that was my fault). I didn’t want to make a scene so took it no further however, I was left shaking and in shock that someone had spoken to me like that and for the first time ever I asked for the service charge to be removed which was a shame as our waiter and the food was great however, that experience could have completely been avoided had she been apologetic and calm as opposed to down right aggressive and rude. May I suggest that this staff member has further training or takes up employment at an establishment more suited for her level of customer service skills, perhaps a weatherspoons."
15,"very polite staff very helpful , always helping with your needs and fast with your drinks especially Dario that serves our table . Recommend coming here if your celebrating a special occasion or coming for some fun with your fiends absolutely stupendous"
16,It is an okay restaurant  What I’ve experienced is far less in quality than what I’ve heard  Service hasn’t been the greatest….few arrogant waitresses…lacking discipline  Waiting time for the main dish has been too long  Would I go again?  No
17,"I took my mum here for lunch as a birthday treat. She had the steak and I had the lamb which both were delicious and the portion sizes of the sides were huge. Our waitress T. Fenyvesi (Trudie) was amazing, so attentive and ensured we had a fabulous time, she is excellent at her job. She really made us feel special and brought out a cake for my mums birthday which was very thoughtful. I can’t wait to come back and try more things on the menu."
18,If you want to eat and drink in possibly the noisiest restaurant in London this is the place due to thumbing loud music combined with paying through the nose for drinks and food this is the place
19,Fantastic service from luminita she gave Fantastis service and made our day. We absolutely love her service. She was A*
20,"What an amazing experience we’ve had! The food was incredible, everything was so tasty and the meat was delicious. Our waiter, Csaba, was super attentive and knowledgeable and Domas made some of the best passion fruit martinis I’ve ever had. The ambience was fenomenal and I cannot wait to be back!!"
21,"Honestly amazing, one of the best lambs I’ve had ever!!!! Definitely recommend Amazing service from Rui please ask for him on your visit here."
22,Rui was an excellent waiter!! Honestly couldn’t ask for better. Lamb was good alongside the Mac and cheese
23,"I went for dinner with my partner tonight and it was absolutely amazing! The hostess Monica and our waiter Fabio were amazing and an asset to the company, thanks to you both for making our dinner and evening so memorable. The food was delicious and honestly I couldn’t fault anything (which I usually do..) The ambiance and service was brilliant!! We both had a really lovely evening and we have booked to return on his birthday later this month, honestly I can’t wait. I would highly recommend anyone to come here, you really won’t be disappointed. Huge thanks to Fabio again for making us feel welcome and extremely special, see you soon."
24,"We went here for a girls night out on our trip to London. We had Fabio as our waiter, an absolutely lovely guy! A lot of humor and good tips about the city were very nice. The food we ate was very good. It was a great evening and we felt well looked after. A little too loud music to be able to talk together at the table, but that was the only negative for us."
25,"Probably the WORST meal I have ever had.  Took my boyfriend here for his 22nd birthday. We went to the STK in London, opposite the novella theatre (the Strand I believe).  I paid £226 for 2 starters, and 2 mains with 3 drinks. Our starters were bland. Our mains (the sirloin steaks, £45 each) were 60% fat and spend our time spitting it out into the napkin provided.  As two younger customers, we were treated differently. Waiters had 0 time for us, but was very chatty and friendly to the older group of 4 next to us.  Real shame."
26,"Amazing service for my girlfriend birthday very polite waiter called Luminita, she was polite, helpful and just overall lovely"
27,"Mixed.  It looks great. They had a lot of trouble finding our booking (10 mins). They wouldn’t allow a friend who’s recently had an op, to sit with us but not eat from the £70 fixed price menu.  Starter and sides really really good. Steak; WAY over cooked!!!! Like properly well done when asked for medium.  Service is nothing special. Music REALLY loud, so couldn’t really chat. Wouldn’t return."
28,Amazing service from Fabio and great food ! Would 100% return again. Perfect for a celebration or special occasion. Really enjoyed.
29,Our waiter Fabio was a big part of our night. He was so welcoming and friendly. The food was amazing. Overall a great meal complimented by an amazing atmosphere. Well done Fabio :)
30,"Absolutely amazing, great and friendly staff and one of the best steaks I’ve ever had Would 100% recommend"
31,"I have been at STK for a friend bday celebration and we felt very welcomed by the Rui’s service, he went above and beyond at all time from explaining the menu until we leave with a great and well communicative environment at all time, checking on us each time to make sure we were happy and satisfied. Thanks Rui for looking after us, we will definitely be back and hopefully we will looked after by you again."
32,"Amazing experience at STK, great atmosphere, delicious food and great service from Rui that looked after us table. 100% recommend I will be back soon!"
33,"Booked lunch ,food menu underwhelming and overpriced. Starters ok, mains steak tomahawk and fillet not great. French fries were padded with paper at base to look more than was there. Chunky chips - about 6 in total. Pork belly like a egg McMuffin with ice cold tomatoes . Deserts - cheesecake and doughnuts very poor. Basically a cocktail bar which offers expensive food with poor portions. Would not return!!!"
34,"I’ve been to STK many times over the years however I’m sad to say, it seems to of gone downhill.  As we had a large number attending, we had the set menu. The Burrata starter was lovely. When the steak and sides came out, it was extremely salty and was hard to taste anything other than salt! Also, most steak restaurants ask you how you like your steak cooked… we were not even asked and it just arrived straight after the starters… considering I like my steak rare, medium was not what I wanted!  The desert wasn’t much better, a bit of candy floss and bits of cake on a serving board. Considering the price we paid, we would have expected a bit more.  The music was extremely loud so we were having to shout across each other in order to have a conversation during the whole meal. As soon as the desert plates were removed, we were basically forced to leave as the table was only for 2 hours!  Every other time I’ve been to STK, I have never been removed from the table. Such a shame as it seems that they have adapted the revolving door approach in order to get more business. We would have spent much more money on cocktails/drinks however we never had that chance. The bar area was so cramped with people we couldn’t even go to that area for more drinks to carry on our night.  Also, just a warning, if there is a birthday, they had some sort of strobe light they used. This did not bode well for someone in our group with epilepsy… sadly, did not even get much of an apology on that one when realistically, it’s quite a big deal!  Doubt I will return again. I think I’ll go to the Hawksmoor."
35,"Food and service is good- decent though not the widest selection when it comes to steaks, but it is very well cooked. Service is attentive without being intrusive which is great. Be prepared for £100 a head if you have wine- arguably a little more pricey than Hawksmoor or Gaucho."
36,"Dario was a very good waiter, so friendly and assertive, gave quick service and made us feel so welcome"
37,Very nice and fancy place with good atmosphere. A bit expensive but 100% worth it. We had Franchesco as waiter and he was fantastic. The Wagyu hanger was abselutely fantastic.
38,All time favorite restaurant. Food and services are very much satisfaction. I go there with my friends. Spend a quality time.
39,First time in STK London Strand We visited for an 30th Birthday in Sat Evening Great DJ feel very nice to the place Our waiter Fabio was amazing 👏 Would definitely go back for next birthday or event Well done STK
40,"I booked STK Strand for my son's birthday meal and the evening was lovely. We were a party of 7 and unfortunately all arrived at different times due to 3 members getting lost. However, the restuarant was very accommodating and did not allowed that to spoil or interrupt our meal whatsoever. Our Waiter Sebastian was very attentive and provided absolute A* service to us all. All staff were welcoming and provided courteous smiles throughout the evening. The food was lovely and the restuarant even gave my son a nice slice of birthday cake and cocktail shots for the enitre group at the end of the evening. Will definitely return for a couples evening meal. Thank you STK for making our night!"
41,Lovely lunch and amazing service from luminita. I am gluten free and she made sure to cater for allergies and made our experience 10/10.
42,I wanted to book this restaurant for my son's 21st - and the customer service was simply the worst I have ever come across - what should have been a lovely experience in the planning was painful and frankly rude - from initial telephone call to all exchange - put simply .... everything was too much trouble ...... - safe to say I didn't book and we went somewhere wonderful - but would not recommend and/or want to have a special event here
43,"We came to STK on a Sunday dinner time for a 40th. It was so much fun. Atmosphere was great, food was yummy and the staff were so lovely. Our waiter Fabio was so attentive but not too in your face! Loved it! The cocktails are pretty nice tool! If you ask nicely they’ll point you in the right direction for the best picture background!"
44,"We came to STK on a Sunday evening, it was such a gorgeous evening, Fabio our waiter was simply perfect, he made everything run so smoothly. One of our party is Coeliac and she was treated with so much respect and was so well catered for. Thank you for having us.. we will be returning asap!"
45,I went to stk and I want to mention how great my waiter was his name was Dario and he was very thoughtful and was great at giving us the best cocktails I hope a general manager sees this and thanks him for being a great waiter  I had lovely food the steak is massive and very filling
46,Loved the food especially the burgers but loved the service mored Fabio was incredible funny and efficient Will come back soon
47,"We visited as a couple for a midweek pre-theatre dinner and chose from the set menu. Options on the set menu were few but all sounded delicious, and we each chose different options so we could taste each other’s. Service was quick to begin with but then nicely spaced between courses so there was no sense of being rushed. All food was delicious and portion sizes were what you’d expect. The restaurant itself is beautiful and what really stood out to us is the camaraderie between staff, who all seemed to genuinely be happy and enjoying their roles, which made for a very pleasant atmosphere. Really enjoyed our meal here and will definitely be returning!"
48,"We recently had a lovely night at STK, great music, food and service. The the potato gratin with truffle was to die for and the pornstar martinis as well! Also a huge thank you to our amazing server Dario who made our night so special with his attentiveness. Truly a prime example of a beyond great server! Will definitely ask for him to serve our table the next time we’re back."
49,"I’ve recently visited the STK Strand to celebrate my partner’s Birthday. We had a considerably good experience. Gorgeous decor, lovely environment and great music.  I was quite disappointed by the food and drinks’ waiting time, but I guess it had to do with how busy the place was. Although we waited over an hour for food we had the most AMAZING waitress with us and she made sure that even whilst waiting we were still okay and looked after.  Luminita was simply five stars, she went above and beyond to ensure we had a good experience and really made our night brilliant, I really couldn’t thank her enough.  You are much appreciated Luminita"
50,I came with the girls for a Saturday meal. The food was of course amazing but the service and the vibe is what made this the best spot for a Saturday. Thank you to Fabio making the time the best!
51,Amazing service and really nice food. We had a 3 course meal which was just perfect! The atmosphere here is the exactly what you would want for a Saturday night in London. Served by Fabio who was just amazing and made our night so special. Thank you so much will be back soon!
52,Had the most amazing time here for my friends birthday the best night in London. Fabio served us and made it so much fun and special for us! Best stake and cocktails!
53,"Best lunch with wonderful service from Fabio, he was so personable and kind. Great food too.  Thank you"
54,Excellent night at STK! Truly five star! The service we received was unreal! we had Dario s our water and he was superb! genuinely recommend and food and dink was top tier too ! They really know what they’re doing with the music! It’s such a vibe they create!
55,"We had such a lovely night! We were served by Dario and the service was SUPERB! The food was tasty and service was fast even with the busy restaurant! Really impressed by the speed and the attention given to us! Wow! A great night out too with the music! We got bottles, had a lovely vibe with the girlies! Will defo be back!"
56,Amazing service from Dario he made us feel so welcome and was so attentive to all of our needs. Made my daughter birthday dinner extra special. Thank you loads.
57,"Great experience at STK. Dario was our waiter, he is excellent, great customer service. Really enjoyed the experience! Will cone again! X"
58,The meal and service was amazing would highly recommend. There was a waitress called Luminita who honestly provided outstanding service with drinks and food and cleaning the table for us. Made it an enjoyable first experience.
59,Loved the food especially the burgers but loved the service mored Dario was incredible.. attentive and pleasing and attentive!
60,Really enjoyed our dinner. Server(forgot name) was excellent and food was amazing. American steaks with great flavour. Get the little burgers! Place is really trendy with good atmosphere.
61,Best night out in a long time. I heard many times about this place but never been there till last Saturday. Great cocktails and really good sets from DJ
62,Most disgusting meal I’ve ever had.  Steak was completely full of fat. Lamb had two mouth fulls that’s it. Me and my partner had a side of mash each which was swimming in grease from all the amounts of cheese.  On arrival we were asked if we wanted water for the table then got charged £5.50 for water when a coke was £4.50!  It’s pitch black can’t see the food which is a pretty good sign as it’s vile. Service charge £15 when we didn’t even eat the food.  Wasted £130 on 30 mins didn’t even finish our meals we just paid and left.  Would never return to this place. We travelled 40 mins to have a meal and we still left hungry!!! Considering this was apart of a 21st birthday weekend it wasn’t anything but awful.
63,"Very nice place. We visited for an 18th Birthday in the early afternoon on a Saturday.  Great music (mix of Motown & Soul), really nice feel to the place. Staff were great, food was brilliant (we had Burgers, Lobster Tails and 2 Fillet Steaks and triple cooked chips. Was really nice food. Would definitely go back and recommend."
64,Been there couple of times and never disappointed. Fillet steak it's one of the best i had so far. Highly recommended this place
65,"A birthday treat that went horribly wrong. Following being given the drinks menu my daughter asked for a cocktail… myself being a recovering alcoholic asked for a list of non alcoholic drinks, I was advised that there was no list but advised what there was and suggested that I could choose from the cocktail list and they would ensure that it had no alcohol I.e make me a mocktail… when the server come back to the table he stated that it was in fact a mocktail and went off although to my horror at the very moment I took a mouthful he returned to announce that my drink actually had alcohol in, something that at that time having just swallowed I was painfully aware of!! When our server come back and asked if we was ok I explained the situation, we was offered the drinks on the house as a sorry!! Also we had a voucher and didn’t reach the amount on it, at the end we was asked if we would like to order more drinks to make up the amount, due to wanting to get out and the fact we had a show to get to we asked to just have it in voucher and they said they couldn’t do this… so in fact the “free drinks were not free anyway” and to add to that the steak was terrible, flavourless and extremely chewy!! I have emailed the restaurant twice about this and had no response. I’d advise to avoid, and especially advise any fellow recovering alcoholics to not trust anything other than water."
66,I have been there with a couple of friends and couldn't be more happy. Service and food was outstanding. Will definitely be back.
67,Fabio is amazing !!!! Love youuuu He did everything he can to make our experience great!!! Nobody like Fabio !!! You are a star !!!! Beautiful waiter
68,I was having such a bad day until I stubbled across Helbert who was soooo amazing with the great customer service he provided and somehow manage to make me laugh and smile.
69,So if you are looking for a budget meal this isn't the place  If u seek a good meal in a good atmosphere then this is the place  Nice dim lighting with DJ playing good music of chilled dining nature at a chilling volume  Wine £60 a bottle  Just had a main surf and turf filet steak with sides  Very nicely cooked and flavour kept  Three sides was enough for us to share  Good service at table  Not cheap but would def eat there again and recommend to friends looking for a special place for a meal  Opportunity to get very dressed up but as the passing tourist we were allowed in and felt comfortable in our shorts and T-shirt
70,Fabio is the 10/10 service and the best about . He truely helped me out and the service was Fantastic. Genuinely a pleasure to be around . Offered me amazing service . Deserves the best out of STK. he made sure the groups steak was to perfection as well .
71,"Best night ever!!! Fabio served us and we had so much fun, he also offered to take took our pictures which came out so lushh we had to share !!!!!!!!"
72,"First time attending STK Strand and my friends and I were pleasantly welcomed by the reception team. Our waiter Daniel was very helpful with the menu and looked after us. Hope to come back again soon however, the food could be improved (flavour)."
73,"Steak was average, enjoyed the customer service. Our waiter Daniel welcomed us and took care of us the whole night!"
74,"Definitely would recommend! Lovely service from Dario and brilliant atmosphere, brilliant music and vibe."
75,"Beautiful restaurant with brilliant service. Our waiter was Dario, he was very attentive and helpful throughout our stay. Hands down the best steak I have every had. Would definitely recommend coming here."
76,"Lovely meal here, service was amazing. Our waiter Dario was very attentive. Ensured our glasses were always topped and informed us on food & drink options when we needed!"
77,First time visiting stk and Dario was so informative and happy. I will definitely be back. The food and drinks were amazing and I enjoyed my experience
78,Dario was an excellent server and I really enjoyed our visit to the restaurant. The drinks are absolutely fantastic! I would recommend the “sweet- hart” cocktail
79,"We went to stk last night for the first time, and we amazed by every aspect from the decor to service and especially the food. We came to celebrate my sisters 21st birthday and Dario made it a night to remember. I would without a doubt recommend to everyone and we would like to say thank you to the team and especially Dario, we hope to see you soon!!!"
80,"This place is a wonderfully decorated space that values service and presentation in a non pretentious setting. The music is fun and lively, which adds to the ambiance. My primary server - Herbert - was a true delight from start to finish and one of the most friendly and attentive servers I’ve had in London in years. The food was a standout as well especially the power lunch menu, which was an outstanding value given the quality and flavour of the food as well as the quantity and presentation, but there are also other specials throughout the week including happy hour, pre-theatre and date night menus. I would definitely go back and highly recommend anyone goes to have a special occasion with your friends and family."
81,"Desperately trying to find somewhere to eat without having too have a pre booking, we literally stumbled upon the STK restaurant. No pressure booking required, however a minimum spend of £60 is required!! This isn’t too difficult as the orchid for the stack are just for the steak, any sides ie chips are extra. My husband ordered the filet steak which was melt in the mouth delicious. I had the mushroom and truffle tagliatelle which was really tasty. A very good experience and lovely food. Would definitely recommend."
82,"Lovely visit it was my first time here and Dario made sure it was super special , I will be coming back with my freinds and family definitely!!!"
83,Drio really looked after me and friends. Was very attentive and treated us like queens. Best experience in a restaurant in a while ❤️
84,"Best birthday brunch!!!! Me and my friends had the best brunch thank you to Fabio, we will be returning"
85,Thank you to Fabio for making my sisters birthday brunch amazing!! And keeping our drinks topped up x
86,"We had the most amazing experience thanks to Humberto out server. We just felt so spoiled at this restaurant, a true gem. We have eaten at 3 Michelin star restaurants and never had such a personal yet non invasive service. Honestly I would come back just to feel as pampered as we did today, thanks to Humberto.  That said, food was impressive, probably the best steak we have had in years. Would recommend and Certainly come back when in London.  Thanks STK and thnks Humberto!!"
87,"Here for my good friends birthday Dario took the best care of us and recommended which cocktails we like depending on our preference and helped with the menu as this was my first time here. Very helpful and patient as I changed my order about 3 times. The restaurant is clean and lively with dj even on a Sunday when we came. Really lovely for birthdays, anniversary’s etc and a good excuse to dress up. Thank you Dario and team for making our night a good one."
88,Amazing service by Dario! Food was beautiful! Would defiantly recommend❤️ Had such a good time! Steak was cooked to perfection
89,"I went to STK since I was in Covent Garden, and it was really amazing! The staff were so friendly and accommodating then the food and wine was just incredible and very tasty, so much so that we finished every single bit of it! Finally, how can you not miss the Truffle Mac N Cheese?! It was the best one I’ve tasted"
90,"Don't listen to the negative reviews of some 'Karen's' complaining of their steak not being well done enough and oozing blood (...really). This is a proper restaurant, not weatherspoons! If you are asking for a fillet 'well done' then just get in the sea.  Went here in July with the missus for a birthday date night. I love steak and have eaten a lot of it over the years. I can say that the medium sized fillet I had here (with lobster side) was absolutely fantastic, cooked to perfection (I like it medium/rare). I would put it amongst the top 3 steaks I've ever had  Yeah it's a bit on the pricier side, likewise with the wine selection, but I don't mind paying for a bit of quality - it's not like I'm eating here every night of the week.  Service was crisp and attentive and I even got a slice of birthday cake. Fantastic"
91,"I came here to celebrate my friends birthday and Helbert our waiter was incredibly amazing. He was so helpful, friendly and lovely and made our time incredibly enjoyable. He made sure that the birthday girl had an amazing time. Would come back here purely because of him!!"
92,"We visited late one evening. Unlike many other local restaurants the kitchen took orders until 11 pm. Food came promptly and was well cooked. Ribeye was particularly good. Service was pleasant and attentive. However prices are quite high - £50 for a ribeye steak with not even garnish, let alone fries or sides, is quite steep. Order a couple of sides and you are looking at £70. Pathetically they could only offer two dessert options - which is really not on for a decent restaurant."
93,Great venue. Expensive but very tasty. Excellent service. Nice tables for large groups. Shout out to Dario who looked after us so well!
94,"Had a meal at STK this evening for me and my fiances joint birthday party with friends.  The venue is very cool, great vibe, good music and excellent service, especially from our waiter Dario. Very polite, always coming to make sure we are happy and comfortable, continuing to keep the lady's glasses topped up and our beers flowing, Great experience thank you!"
95,Our host Dario was absolutely amazing ensured our drinks were tipped up at all times! Best experience!
96,"Dario was the best server, so lovely, so attentative. Very good at his job. Was made to feel comfortable. The best service ever! Made my 21st birthday!!"
97,"We had a fabulous celebration dinner for my daughters results..... cocktails were tasty, service AMAZING, and the food was delicious. Great ambiance.....and we stayed slightly over our time allocation without being hassled out. Thank you Fabio, best waiter in Town. Will definitely visit again!"
98,"Finally got a chance to experience this restaurant after all the hype we was told about it... Sadly it didn't live up to all the expectations we thought we was gonna get.. Don't get me wrong some things on the plate was very nice but the main parts of the meals was a bit of a let down.. My partner ordered the ancho chili rubbed striploin steak which she asked to be done Medium but was cooked well done & mine a wagyu picanha, first two - three cuts was absolutely stunning then it just went a bit chewy, A nice taste but a Big let down. The triple cooked chips was ok but had better, Mac & cheese with bacon, - ( not a lot of bacon ) & i can't believe I'm gonna put this but had better in a Miller & Carter..... But like i mentioned there was some upsides to the Dishes, the STK Bold sauce was lovely, crispy baby potatoes was nice spot on, cocktails was very good, But if ya paying £187.88 for two mains & four drinks you expect it to be spot on...."
99,"I came here with 5 girl friends. We all loved it! We had the pre theatre menu which was such good value (apart from the side at £9 each but it is central London) Our waitress Luminita was exceptional. Starters of mini burgers were so so good, main steak also wonderful and beautifully cooked and in that menu you can have a wine for £5, wine was delicious! We loved the vibe of the place and music. Definitely would like to return."
100,"So, our visit started off well. The manager greeted us with, we hope we can make your evening an enjoyable one. I was excited.  Then - it went downhill. The service is unbelievably bad - like so bad I’m almost lost for words. They rush about like they are serving a million people, no calm classy service available here!  I advised I wanted my steak very well done - no blood - the server says, you know it won’t be tender right, I say, it’s always tender elsewhere so should be fine.  My steak arrives with sides you have to pay extra for - £9 for garlic butter!! But I thought - if the food is great then cool.  I ate a bit of the steak - the sides were incredible - and noticed my steak was a bit spongey - the light is so low that I put my camera torch on and pressed my steak - it poured with blood! This could have dealt with so well - apologise, take it away and come back with a new one, cooked how I like it.  Nope - the manager was so rude and patronising - could not care less that I found the fact I’d eaten some revolting - spent the entire time arguing with me about why I would ruin steak in this way and that it wasn’t blood but cooking juices. I know blood is blood. I am an avid fillet eater - I know steak! My daughters was the same.  We decided to leave after they stormed off with the sides they we had asked them to keep them hot whilst they corrected my daughters steak - I could not eat another thing as felt do nauseated- they could not care less about us leaving.  Horrible people and place!"
101,"I visited stk for my birthday and enjoyed myself. There was a issue with my order but my server Dario cleared it up so quickly! The atmosphere is lovely, would defo a recommend!"
102,We visited STK for my best friends birthday! It was the best service ever and our server Dario exceeded our expectations!!! Would definitely recommend coming here. We will definitely come back here!
103,"The service we received was shockingly poor. After such a wait for our order to be taken I did suggest to my dad we should go eat else where after our order was finally taken they did apologise as they was so busy in a nearly empty restaurant, we was offered some complementary bread which was lovely however afterwards the waitress was about to leave my mum with a dirty knife and she had to be asked to take it, when our food arrived it was very tasty however I was still eating when our table was cleared so that was me done as I find this so very rude and ignorant. This is not a family restaurant the language from the table next to us was shocking and they was very loud and loutish. This is not somewhere I would frequent again or suggest to anyone I was very pleased my daughter was not with us."
104,"The happy hour , lunch specials , and drinks are beyond. Dario our waiter has exceeded our expectations. I am a regular at the Orlando stk location in which I get a cucumber stiletto , Dario went above and beyond to ensure I get my fave stk drink. Thank you for a yummy and serendipitous lunch"
105,Came to STK with friends and enjoyed the happy hour. We all enjoyed the martinis and Strawberry Cobbler cocktail. Dario made our experience here even better. His personality and service shined through. I would recommend everyone visit this amazing establishment
106,"Had the best lunch ever with my girls. Dario went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our lunch , from the food to the drinks and Efficiency of service ; I would give it 10 stars if I could. Thank you Dario and stk strand!!"
107,"Food 5 star Staff 5 star, great surrounding. Trendy and private. Easy to get to, smells and looks great, works for every setting, work, special occasions business meeting. And next to a hotel so great for a date!"
108,"Dario was amazing, suggested the perfect wine to go with our food and food came promptly. Great service would definitely come back again. Thank you Dario for making my birthday special !!!!!"
109,"Dario was such an excellent waiter, attentive, great sense of humour and personality and made the evening for us !"
110,"First time here but definitely not last  Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. The venue itself its stunning and modern. It was really cool that they even had DJ. Great variety of food and very delicious. One of my favourites for the evening was the salmon tartare with the twist of mango, perfect light summer dish. Will be definitely coming back to try out the rest."
111,Beautiful place delicious food amazing cocktails VINCENT YOU ARE THE BEST Thank you see you soon
112,"Fantastic place, great service and food. Vincent is the best !!! 💪 Great place to go with friends, great night!"
113,Food and service is excellent and the place has a very cool vibe overall. We dined at the restaurant on Thursday evening and had a most amazing time! Thanks to Vincent he made our night special
114,"Fantastic dinner, great service and food. Highly recommended! Thank you Vincent you’re the best! 🥂🥂🥂"
115,"We visited on a Thursday evening, the service and food was fabulous. Shem & luminita have Amazing service and hospitality and would recommend coming to STK for a date night / meal whenever you can! The mini burgers are the BEST! No one beats them"
116,"Prior to attending, we were informed by phone of strict smart casual dress code and that there was a minimum spend of £60 per head. Both of these things felt quite arrogant.  On arrival, we were greeted with an atmosphere more akin to cross between a nightclub and love island, with the music far too loud and the dress code we were informed about clearly not enforced. (People were in shorts and t shirts).  The food was good, but the meal was very overpriced and the experience did not offer value for money. If you’re going to be arrogant, at least match it with end product."
117,I had THE best time last night at The London strand - the best service - amazing food and our server Luminta was outstanding! Great spirit and great attentiveness. Over great general management at that location. Thank you STK London Strand!!
118,Excellent restaurant and excellent staf..Food is wonderfull..service professional.. Not to miss..Steak delicious..Salads special taste..bravi
119,"Amazing service from Davide. Amazing chat, brilliant food and great atmosphere. Will definitely be back. I highly recommend coming here for a celebratory night out."
120,The prices here are unbelievable! Dark room with a small candle to read the expensive menu. Music blasting while you eat. £110 for a T bone steak and £9 each for sides!!! Waiter was very polite and professional.
121,The food is so great also!! There is on street carpark! Davide also arranged a birthday cake thank you !
122,"Great lunch with friends, Dario our waiter was amazing and very helpful throughout our time there. Would recommend the steak and calamari! Tropical kiss cocktail was lovely and strong"
123,"Had an amazing time at STK for lunch with my niece and sister! We were served by a lovely waiter Dario, he was very attentive and knew the best food to recommend. Great cocktails, calamari and lil brgs were so delicious. Will be back again!"
124,Great food and ambiance! The steaks are great the pasta dishes are a bit on the small side. The service was not good at all as it was both very slow and felt like we were abandoned at times!
125,I had a warm welcome to the restaurant and my server Davide was friendly and helpful. The food was very good and he helped me pick the right dishes based on my tastes and appetite. Would recommend
126,"Food was so delicious and service was very attentive. Our waiter knew menu in and out and answer all our questions. The wine selection was incredible and the manager who a came to check on us was very polite and it was nice personal touch! The atmosphere was fantastic, definitely we will be back very soon"
127,"Made reservations for dinner. Placed our order and after waiting 45 minutes for our main course, we canceled it and left."

136,My steak was overdone and not to my liking and darrio dealt with it amazingly - quick and efficient.
137,"I had a great experience at stk for my friends bday, our host Dario was so friendly and helpful :) I’m pregnant and he brought me a few different options that I could have. I would definitely come here again and special shout out to Dario for being such a great host"
138,Dario is the nicest server ever. He’s so friendly and helpful. He has taken care of us all night. The best
139,"Amazing service from Dario, he was very welcoming and very polite to us made us feel very welcome !!"
140,"Came here for a birthday dinner, the food was lovely, especially the side macaroni cheese. Steak was great but I asked for medium rare and definitely was more well done, but was a good steak. A overall lovely experience here and would come back."
141,"I visited STK Strand on a Friday evening for dinner with two friends. This review is of course just personal opinion on the experience.  We are all early 20s and found the vibe to be quite cool and stylish - I wouldn't say it's the best spot for taking your granny or for a family dinner, but for youngsters I can see it would have appeal. The music was quite loud and seemed to get more so as the evening progressed and we were having to shout to hear each other at times (with our table very near the speakers).  In terms of the food - the bread for the table was delicious and starters were good (particularly liked the Calamari). My steak was good but both of my friends' fillets were significantly overcooked - we flagged this to our server and they happily redid our dishes, brought the sides again and also gave us an extra bottle of rosé to compensate. Having a sweet tooth, I also really loved the choc chip cookie/ice cream dessert!  The service was pretty good all evening - the aforementioned dealing with the overcooked steaks plus our server was attentive (e.g. regularly topping up our glasses, cleaning the table) and helpful.  We had a very nice evening but the vibe wasn't perfect (it was mainly the loud music which became annoying) and the bill came to more than £100 a head, and that was with one of the bottles of wine on the house. I would more strongly recommend Smith & Wollensky down the road or Gaucho for a slightly better experience for a comparable/marginally cheaper cost."
142,"We were told we had the table for 2 hours. 1.5 hours later and our mains still hadn’t arrived. We had 20 minutes to eat mains and pay the bill- no time for desserts. Our waiter was attentive and cleaned the table regularly but the service in the rest of the restaurant was pretty poor, the music was too loud we couldn’t hear each other and the table next to us were so drunk they fell onto us and our table a few times. I didn’t enjoy my meal, the texture of the meat wasn’t as expected for the price, portions were small but filling. I wouldn’t go back or recommend personally."
143,"We were a large group of 13 that were originally squeezed on to a table meant for 10 Max. Thankfully they were not too busy so moved 6 to the next table,better but not ideal when we were out in a group. Then 3 bottles of still & 3 bottles of sparkling water started to get poured to our group,which we pressumed must be part of the set menu that we had to book. Within minutes of the water being poured it was like a pressure sell on the wine list ,with little time to look through the list. We eventually chose the wine only to be told a few minutes later it was out of stock,so had to order a more expensive red. The starters arrived in a timely manner and was average at best but with the restaurant being so dimly lit it was an effort to see what we had. The Stark and sides again came out all together but the pieces of steak I myself had were fatty,the sides were warm at best. Desert platters were small but ok. Apart from the huge mark up on drinks 300% (water £5.75+ vat per bottle) plus the icing on the cake was the cheek of our table server asking for a separate tip on top of the £160+ plus service charge. He had the front to put £100 tip on the card reader and asked my wife to press yes,luckily my wife's friend stopped her as she thought it was £10 ( few to many wines). Overall your paying fine dining prices for an average at best meal out."
144,The service and atmosphere was amazing! Food came out on time and had a great server! Thank you Davide for making this experience amazing!
145,"STK is amazing :) We went to STK for my fiancé’s 40th birthday celebrations. It was a great atmosphere, food was amazing and the service was excellent ❤️ our waiter Davide was so nice, made us feel so welcome and just made the experience so special as nothing was a problem. Thank you Davide. we will be recommending STK London."
146,Davide was our waiter for tonight and he was absolutely amazing! He was so kind and attentive and took the time to explain the different tastes of a variety of meals on the menu. I was so pleased with his service a 10/10 from me and my friends he definitely made our night!
147,Davide was amazing he was me and my friends waiter all night he was attentive and committed. This is my second time here and I would always come back it’s a beautiful scene with lovely staff and the pretty decorations. It’s up town would recommend for birthdays or celebrations
148,The experience was very good. I feel like the waiter David went the extra mile and surprised us with a birthday/ anniversary cake. Overall we thought the staff go above and beyond to please their customers. Would definitely come back to STK!
149,"Great food & great service from Rui, was very attentive & made sure our glass was never empty. Will be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
150,"Great service all round, especially by our waiter Davide, he was very friendly and helpful and accommodating. He gave great cocktail recommendations"
151,Lovely food and ambiance! Great drinks and amazing service from Davide! Will definitely go back !!!!!!
152,"The food was nice, but not good enough for the prices they are charging. As a small group of girls, we liked the vibe but it was so unbelievably busy, our table had people stood next to us ‘waiting in the bar’ the whole night. The music was so loud that we had to shout just to talk to each other. Every single waiter looked completely rushed off their feet. The restaurant was also full of groups of men hanging around the bar and toilets, trying to pick up girls, which was quite off putting.  The waiter assigned to our table was nice but rarely checked on us and we had to flag them down every time we needed something. Food took 50 minutes to arrive so we decided to remove the service charge (an additional £30+). After this the waiter turned very rude and ignorant and tried pleading with us to keep the service charge on. It made us feel very awkward.  Such a shame as we were really excited for our visit but we would not go back. Better steak and experiences in other London steakhouses."
153,We booked STK for a friends birthday and one of the party had to send the steak back twice and mine was rare when I’d asked for medium.. but what was really poor was the customer service or lack of it.. such a shame but we’d not eat here again. If you’re after a decent steak with brilliant customer service go to BEAST!
154,"Came here about 6 months ago didn't have the best time, what a difference this was! The service was amazing the food was delicious and they even brought out cake for my daughter as it was her birthday. We had the best time & she cannot wait to come back! Thank you very much!"
155,"My daughter booked a surprise Dinner for my birthday, I was so excited. Soon as you walk through the doors, The surroundings look beautiful. We were made to feel welcome by the lovely gentleman that greeted us first, he brought us to the table and left us with a smile and our Waiter for the evening Rui, who tended to us throughout the whole night. He definitely contributed to our great evening.  Rui recommended  Starter - Crispy calamari basil - padron peppers - roasted garlic & lime aioli - asian chili sauce  Main - Wagyu Picanha MBS 6/7 with side’s  Dessert - Apple Pie cinnamon crumble - maple creme fraiche  Cocktails - Tropical Kiss -Sweet-Hart and two Winter Storm, Tasted lovely.  All the dishes were deliciously enjoyable. The Chef was definitely dexterous, skilled hands make a good Chef.  This was both our first times at STK, We would like to say, Thank you all for a gratifying experience."
156,"Celebrated our daughters 18th birthday here on Sunday 17th April, the atmosphere was brilliant and we all had a lovely time. We skipped starters to ensure we could enjoy our mains, we sampled the complimentary bread which was absolutely delicious. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and our sides were tasty and hot. Even though we all opted for the smaller steak sizes we were glad we did as there was plenty! We were all pretty full so decided on a couple of desserts to share, these too were delicious, our server than came out of the kitchen with a slice of celebration cake for our daughter which was a lovely gesture. Cocktails were lovely and very moreish!! My younger daughter really enjoyed her mocktail too. Yes it is pricey but for a special occasion we felt it was worth it, we are all looking forward to the next time we have an excuse to visit. Thank you to the whole team for making our daughters birthday even more memorable!"
157,We went for dinner om a Sunday night with family and the place was very busy and the music playing was really good. Our waiteress was Beata and she was so friendly. The manager on duty was Kyle who went out of his way to make sure our dinner was A1.  Lovely venue and deco. Highly recommended and always full of people wanting to have a good time.  Thank u to everyone for a memorable evening on a Sunday night.  Will be back with the rest of the gang.  Thank you team. Sonia and Raj
158,Fantastic venue with great wine and food and service. Highly recommended for early business dinner. Will be back!
159,"Great service! David is an awesome waiter, he recommended on a lot of great food and drinks. The place is lovely and we really enjoyed everything. Thank you!"
160,"Had a nice meal at STK, had a problem with a dish and Rui sorted it out for us. Rui is such a great guy!"
161,We celebrated my husband’s 30th birthday dinner with family and every member of the team were so helpful and ensured we had a fantastic time. A special thanks to Bea for delivering top service throughout the evening and Stams the restaurant manager for ensuring the birthday surprise went to plan!
162,"Was recommended to try this place by my son and it was a good shout.  It’s a great location, just south of Covent Garden and close to Somerset House. Very funky vibe (integrated to the Me Hotel) and as the name suggests it’s all about the steak.  I kicked off view the Caesar which was decent, a tidy portion and nicely put together. My main was the zabuton cut, which I’d never had before. I was warned it was beefy and it is, a really flavoursome cut and I had it medium as suggested. I had it topped with a chimichurri sauce, some peppercorn sauce on the side and we had some triple cooked chunky chips , cauliflower cheese and some asparagus on the table. The cut was good but, for me, I prefer more fat on my steak so not sure I’d have it again and go for a rib eye or similar. But nothing wrong with it just personal choice.  They also service awesome bread, which I mistook for a dessert when a loaf was delivered to a neighbouring table!  Beer, wine and company all made for a spectacular lunch. They don’t rush you here and I’ll look forward to returning soon."
163,Do NOT book the pre-theatre menu! Me and my friends booked the pre theatre menu. We see the menu online on their website for £30pp. When the bill arrived it was £49pp. We raised this with the waiter. He said that the pre-theatre menu is £49pp not £30pp. We showed them the menu online and he said that is an old menu. STK should update their website as customers are provided with incorrect information. They refused to budge! They should honour this as it is false advertisement. The £49pp menu also included wine which was not offered to all of us.  This is a pre-theatre menu which finishes at 7.00pm. Our deserts were not bought over to our table until 7.25pm (baring in mind that the theatre show starts at 7.30pm). We had to box up our deserts in time to catch the show!  Very disappointed in STK as have been their numerous times and had a pleasant experience.
164,"A message of gratitude to one of the best waiters I have ever had, Ahmed. I dined at STK London on Thursday 31st March.at 18:30. I was dining with my colleagues as a celebration. AHMED truly made it a memorable night with exceptional service, patience with my guests and excellent impartial advice on our wine selection. He is the single reason why I will recommend why people should visit STK. A credit to the restaurant and made the incredible food and experience that much better."
165,"My friends and I went to STK for a girly catch up. And it did not disappoint- the food was superb, the staff were very attentive. The atmosphere was great, we stayed for hours on end. Can’t wait to come back again.  Thank you to everyone who made the night so special x"
166,This was suppose to be a pleasant Sunday lunch for Mother’s Day. It was awful more like going to overly loud club on a Saturday night. Impossible to talk we had to leave. Would not go back under any circumstances. Mother’s Day ruined.
167,Best night of my life come come come would recommend good food food drinks come get drunk cheap night our
168,brilliant service great live music and great server david thank you!! would definatly recommend for a night out
169,"We had the Sunday roast which was very value for money. Two thick cuts of roast beef, thick-cut truffle fries, roasted vegetables, and surprise surprise truffle Mac and cheese. Food was excellent. Atmosphere in general was nice. Our service staff Fabio was warm and friendly, and made us feel at home. Thanks Fabio!"
170,Visited on a business trip and had the private dining area Had to pre order but food was good and arrived in reasonable time  The private dining area is a little quieter than main area but that suited us  Toilets are quite a walk from restaurant  Food was of good quality and the macaroni cheese was so good
171,Absolutely amazing service from our waiter Fabio to complement the brilliant food served. Highly recommend
172,"Extremely worth for money! We had the beef Sunday Roast and have been to multiple places in London to try their roasts. However, this place is the best! The beef slices were thick and the truffle Mac and cheese was amazing! The best part was the service - we were served by Fabio and he was patient and professional. Towards the end of the meal, he even presented my boyfriend and I with a slice of cake on the house as it was our anniversary. Dining here has been nothing short of a pleasure. I’ll be back for sure!"
173,"Had such a good night here for my birthday with my friends, the food and drink was great and great service from Dario!"
174,"Came here for dinner, very lively and had a great server Dario. Would definitely recommend to others"
175,Great service and great food all night long!! Cocktails taste incredible and so did the fillet steak would recommend to anyone
176,"I visited here with my friend all of the way from Wales. We were served by the amazing Dario and Attila. They really made our night, their customer service skills were excellent and couldn’t wish for better waiters. The food was also outstanding. Would definitely return. Hope Dario and Attila get some credit for this! Thank you."
177,"Food was Amazing, steak was cooked perfectly. The waiter was brilliant, helpful, and very kind and polite. Loved the atmosphere and the decor, definitely come back."
178,From the moment we walked it the service has been attentive. Staff are friendly and seem to want to make our experience the best it can be. The food was utterly incredible. Words can't explain this excellent evening.
179,"Most amazing experience, best waiters Sebastian and Fabio!!!, would definitely recommend this restaurant!!"
180,"Me and my friend were served by Davide, he was amazing really friendly and asked if we would like his recommendation on what drinks to get. Service was great"
181,"Davide was excellent, always on the ball and gave us exceptional manners. Will defo be coming again."
182,Had a great experience at STK. our waiter Davide was extremely friendly and helpful. The food was amazing and couldn’t have had a better night!
183,David was great drinks were good food was ok definitely not the best steak I’ve ever had if we’re being honest
184,Experienced very poor service while celebrating a friends birthday. Also last night in London so unfortunate that this was our experience during the last night. Party of 3… everyone sat down at same time. 2 of the group went to take pictures. One remaining ordered drinks for the table. While other two taking pictures the one remaining asked if she could order a Caesar salad (the others didn’t want appetizers) Waiter (won’t give name) said no appetizer and no bread (free bread) can be given unless full group is seated. BUT I WAS ALLOWED TO ORDER DRINKS FOR FULL TABLE WITHOUT EVERYONE BEING THERE!!! The waiter then proceeds to tell me we only have 5 minutes left to order. Food came out.. mashed potatoes cold. One medium well steak was over cooked. Wrong sauces gave for the steaks. Overall unnecessarily rude and put a damper on our last night in London We are frequent diners at STK NYC and have never experienced this type Of service. Will not visit again in London!
185,Would definitely recommend! The food is delicious and the service is amazing! David is perfectly very helpful!
186,"David was an excellent waiter very clued up on the menu, really lovely to deal with food was the best in London would highly recommend! Food and service on point !!"
187,"Lovely customer service, the food was amazing and almost instantly cooked for us. Nothing bad to say at all. Would definitely come back again and Davide was an amazing waiter!"
188,Had a great experience here today with my girls. The food was really nice and the cocktails are great. Not my first and not my last time coming here
189,Came for my Birthday and they was so friendly and nice! Definitely recommended and will be coming again. Dario and Attila were very helpful.
190,"Lovely atmosphere, great service and our servers Dario and Attila were brilliant. Would definitely recommend a visit!"
191,Dario and attila have an amazing service best I had in a long time. Lovely atmosphere and lovely night out 5*
192,"Came here for friends birthday, such a good experience and great service from Dario and Attila. Great drinks, would definitely recommend"
193,"Incredible food and ambience. My friends and I were attended by a lovely waiter, Nicolas and she made the experience even better by providing amazing customer service"
194,"Visited STK today for the first time for my dads birthday. We had an amazing time, the Lil brgs are to die for. Our waitress Nicola was very helpful and accommodating."
195,"I booked dinner here as a birthday treat for my partner on Saturday 12th March. Our table was booked for 21.00. We arrived 15 mins early, and had a drink at the bar whilst we waited to be seated.  Our table became available at 21.20 (20 minutes late) which was fine (or so we thought!) After sitting down for maybe 2 minutes AT MOST we were asked what we would like to order. We advised the waitress we had only just sat down so would like a bit more time to look at the menu.  We ordered Calamari as a starter to share, and a Porterhouse steak.  We were told after we ordered our starter that the kitchen had to change the oil, so the wait for the Calamari would be about 20 minutes or so. We said we would be happy to wait - the waitress took our order. She then came back and said that we can't order the calamari as it's showing as 'out of stock' until the kitchen can cook it again, and she couldn't process the order on her computer. She asked us if we would be happy to go straight to the main course, and have the Calamari when it was ready. We said we wouldn't be happy with this, and would prefer our starter first followed by the main! The waitress advised she was concerned we wouldn't have enough time to eat both our courses as we only had 1 hour left on our table (I advised that we were 20 minutes late being seated so that wasn't our fault!)  The Calamari came out (after about 15 minutes) It was mediocre but we were starving by this point!  Out came our main - we paid £110.00 for a Porterhouse steak (medium rare) and to say we were disappointed was an understatement.. it was tough and chewy. Not what you would expect from any steak house, let alone STK!  My partner called over the 'Assistant Manager' to explain we were unhappy with our food and the quality of our steak. His response was 'What do you want me to do about it?' We were shocked at the attitude, and completely taken aback by the complete lack of customer service and zero empathy or apology!  The 'Assistant Manager' then repeated ""what do you want me to do about it"" to which my partner said please can you take it back.  He took it back, we weren't offered another steak that was cooked properly to replace the one that wasn't. When my partner queried this again, we were told by the same 'Assistant Manager' ""I think it's best you leave - I'll get you the bill!""  We weren't kicking up a fuss, just simply explaining that the food we had ordered for a substantial amount of money wasn't satisfactory, so to be told to leave was absolutely gobsmacking!  He got us the bill (took our main off) and stood over us whilst we were reading the bill. I asked him politely if he could just give us a few minutes to take a look at the bill, which he did.  He came back, picked my debit card off the table, used the contactless card and put it back on the table once the transaction had gone through.  No apology. nothing but complete and utter rudeness.  My partner got my coat and as we walked out of our dinner, the waitress and 'Assistant Manager' were just stood there smirking at us.  I've never felt so embarrassed or treated so poorly at a restaurant in all my life.  When we went to walk out by the main reception, one of the security guards asked if everything was ok. We started to tell him what had happened and he said 'follow me' he took us through some doors to talk to someone (we assumed a proper manager) but he ended up taking us next door to ME. Clearly a tactic they use so people try not to dull the pretentious vibe and poor service of the restaurant.  Note to Assistant Manager & Staff - Customer Service goes a long way. People are paying a lot of money to eat and drink there. We were happy to pay, but would at least expect the food to be of an edible standard.  Just because we weren't dripping in diamonds and veneers doesn't mean we don't deserve to be treated the same as everyone else there (Good job we didn't have any veneers actually as the steak would have broken them!!)  I saved up to treat my partner for his birthday, as you can expect it's not every weekend we go out for dinner in places like that, and it was utterly ruined.  You made us feel like we were absolute dirt - it doesn't cost anything to be kind!!"
196,"Great food and the service was second to none , Bernardo was fantastic and one of the best there is ."
197,One of the best places to visit in London for a nice meal. Lovely staff. Bernardo was lovely with us all night along. Would definitely recommend and come back for sure
198,"We went to STK for dinner last Friday for my daughter's birthday party. From the minute we were greeted to leaving was an amazing experience.  Staff:  we had a lady serving and looking after us, she ensured we were well looked after for food and drinks and accommodated all our needs. she was always around if we need anything  Atmosphere:  The atmosphere was electric, and so much fun. my daughter and her mates were up dancing in true STK fashion. The music the DJ was playing was spot on and keep every one singing and have a great time.  Food and drinks:  The food was amazing, there were four vegetarians with us, all of them loved the food. the non vegetarian dishes were exquisite, the lamb and chicken just melted in your mouth. the truffle fries are a must!!!  We went through quite a lot of cocktail, which went down so well  Overall we had an amazing night and thank you all STK staff for looking after us !!"
199,I went for dinner here on a Friday evening with some girlfriends and though the food was good I would not recommend going to this venue. The wait staff is not what you would expect for a £60 pp minimum spend. Our waitress sat at the table to take our order and spilled our prosecco as she will filling our glasses. Another waitress bought us a bottle of water which we didn't order but were still charged for. Much nicer and more reasonably priced places to go in that area.
200,Wouldn't go to this place again. My daughter paid a lot of money to treat myself and her son. The service was very mediocre. You had to wave a while before you got recognised despite the staff standing around. The calamari was sub standard. I've had better from Iceland. Our main was not hot. We didn't stay for dessert. The bill came over we didn't pay the service charge which we considered way too high. On the whole I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Very over priced food and drink prices. Shame we were really looking forward to it. So disappointed .
201,Dario was the best waiter ever ! He made my friend bday extra special and service was extra fast Iocw him
202,Dario is the best waiter I’ve had made my birthday extra special ! I’ve had the best day and he’s amazing
203,"Always the best time coming here. Darrio made our night so special, so helpful and kind. Had the most amazing night!!"
204,I had the best experience at STK because of my waiter Dario! The service was the best I have seen and the food was unreal.
205,Had an amazing night! Food was lovely! Our waiter Dario made the night - he was so lovely and helped us with everything !!!!
206,"We waited 30 minutes for a table to be ready so we had a drink in the bar. The bar area is ridiculously small, it’s actually the walk way area so are constantly getting pushed aside by people walking to and from the toilets/entrance. Our waitress didn’t smile once and was in an obvious rush to get us in and out. We went straight for mains. These took over an hour to arrive with no apology or acknowledgment of the wait and when it did arrive it was luke warm. For the prices, it was below average food. The bill was bought straight away after they cleared the mains without us asking. Whilst trying to spilt the bill and work out what we individually wanted to paid we had three different people come and ask to take the money. Once we had paid we were then told ‘you need to finish your drinks, the next tables here’ by the rudest manager I’ve come across. We had only been sat at the table 1.5 hours and had a 2 hour time slot. We had to wait 30 mins for our table so we’re utterly disgusted in the way we were being treated. We were more than happy to move to the bar and finish our drinks however we’re gobsmacked in the way we were asked especially after the the long wait for the cold food. The prices are extremely high end and no where near meet the service or food. Wish I had looked at other reviews before booking. Would not recommend."
207,Nice tasty food service was Top Class! AHMED was the Man. Very kind and friendly he went over and above! Great service AHMED your the best.
208,"Visited STK tonight and had the best waiter, Dario was super friendly and efficient! Would 100% recommend if you want amazing food and great service!"
209,"Dario was very pleasant, had an amazing visit everyone should come here and eat the food it’s so good"
210,"Nikola was the most attentive waitress I've ever had. The food was incredible (truffle mac and cheese was life altering, pink roast beef was perfectly cooked!), the bottomless prosecco was flowing and Nikola was one step ahead of us the whole time. Best restaurant experience in London in a LONG time. Will be back 100%! Attentive service and friendly smiling staff - we LOVED our trip."
211,Nikola was an excellent and attentive waitress who never let my drink go empty and couldn't do enough to help our experience be amazing. The food and drink were gorgeous and excellent value for money.
212,"The complimentary bread was nice as were the starter slider burgers, but that was the high point for the food. 3 of our 4 steaks were very poor quality and poorly cooked. When you pay the prices they charge you expect good quality produce.  Also, when we booked the table we were given a 2 hour slot, however, 1 hour 30 minutes in we were asked to leave the table and given 5 minutes to do so, not good when you're paying the prices they charge.  Also not a pleasant experience to go to the toilets to see a group of 6 or 7 men openly snorting drugs at 6 in the evening."
213,"Had a great Saturday night here with the girls, the waiter Dario made the experience even better ! Would come again"
214,"Best service from Dario, he was super helpful and helped us with everything we asked for! Would definitely go again"
215,"Me and my cousin recently went to STK… and the service was amazing, we had such an amazing meal and it was a speedy service. Our waiter Dario was an Angel, he was always around for help and made our evening at STK extra special… very kind! We will definitely be back again soon with another amazing night!"
216,"Dario was great, overall service was amazing! Would definitely recommended to a friend, good drinks and good menu, good atmosphere."
217,"Unreal time, best service from Dario. Nice drink and good menu. Would definitely recommend to for a night out."
218,"Dario was absolutely amazing! Couldn’t fault his service! Will be coming back ASAP Food was unreal, catered for everyone"
219,"The food is absolutely delicious and they offer a nice selection of dishes. The tuna tartare is a true delicacy and the Japanese beef fillet is one of the most tender and flavoursome things ever!  The service was outstanding, special mention to Davide, who is not only a terrific waiter, but also a lovely person! Davide, grazie mille per aver reso il compleanno di mia madre ancora più speciale! (I hope my Italian is not too bad…)  It’s a bit pricey, but the atmosphere is lovely and the restaurant is in a prime location, so considering that plus the quality of the food, definitely recommendable!"
220,"Last-minute for a birthday and I was amazed at the service. The food was exceptional and the service fantastic. Our waiter Dario couldn't do enough, he was very attentive and ensured all our needs were met and offered recommendations which we loved. Thank you."
221,We visited on a busy Saturday night and unfortunately left feeling very disappointed. The only slightly positives I can think of were that the food was ok and the cocktails were good however I do not feel the evening warranted the hefty price tag. Our table was at 7:30pm and we were handed the bill by 8:55pm. The service was extremely rushed and I absolutely do not believe the evening was worth our £250 bill. You could go to a much better restaurant with better quality of food and a lovely atmosphere for half that price. The restaurant/bar area was extremely rowdy and I think the staff were more focussed on those who were just drinking rather than providing a good service to the tables who were actually eating. Unfortunately we would not return here and has put us off going to any other STK restaurants. I have given 2 out of 5 purely because the food was ok.
222,"We came for a birthday meal,  We were greeted by the manager Kyle and the waiter Hellbert.  Helbert was the most helpful guy we could have asked for and made us feel very welcome.  As long as Kyle is running the show and Helbert is his top guy, we’ll be returning customers!  Kind regards, A loyal Brighton customer!  Xx"
223,Probably the worst steak restaurant I’ve ever come across. The service was poor and inefficient. The food was nearly inedible. Reducing the bill doesn’t help ruining a night out. The steak was on a cold plate the meat was Luke warm and totally over cooked. The service was untrained and poor.
224,"Yesterday me and my friends went to STK for my 30th Birthday dinner. The restaurant was beautiful to look at and if you are looking for a photo-op this is your place.  However if you want the pictures to compliment the meal you are out of luck. The food was terrible (steak too chewy, chips cold and the chicken was just not tasty). When my friend told the waiter of this he was kind and took away the food and advised we order something else.  She declined but he was insistent that she deserves to eat. She ordered potatoe agratine.  Then the bill came and they had removed the chicken but charged for the cold chips and replacement food they insisted on. We we asked for this to be reviewed and the waiter, scrambled the receipt and threw the receipt on the floor in a humph . Then proceeded to adapt the receipt in a way that didn’t make sense.  Honestly I can not express my disappointment enough. This place was a terrible choice. My 30th birthday was dampened by this experience. Pictures are wonderful but a restaurant is good food and service but they failed on both counts. I will never go back.  I am not happy and would never subject anyone in my association to the experience."
