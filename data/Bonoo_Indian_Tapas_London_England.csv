Bonoo is in my top favourite two Indian restaurants from the many I have been. From the food, to the staff, to the atmosphere - it was honestly faultless. The chicken lollipops is a MUST!!!! And was my favourite dish out of all the others despite the fact each dish had a perfect blend of flavours. The attention to detail, thanks to the chefs. The manager was fantastic, a very kind gentleman who evidently knows exactly what it means to be a team leader and ensure all is up to the highest standard. Now - a special mention to my favourite barman! Thank you for the Baileys, chocolate orange to be precise tasty! A lovely man.  Thank you! We will be back."

It would be hard to find fault and given the excellence of the service I wouldn't want to. Great and varied food, beautiful and relaxing location and wonderful service. It deserves to be number 1 on TripAdvisor in London. I would recommend the tasting menu and if possible one of the meatasaur and one of the veggiesaur varieties to get the full range."

161,"We learned that Bonoo is the nickname of the owner’s youngest child, a really loving story. It is a great place with really good food, adequate size portions, the tapas concept is splendid as you can try many different dishes! Watch out for the chili prawns, they are spicy, but great!"

164,"The absolute best indian food I've ever had, and great service too. An absolute must try if you're in london."
165,"Had to write a review for Bonoo after my first visit tonight for a family dinner. I have only good things to say about our experience. The restaurant itself has a relaxed, modern vibe, with tapas style Indian dining…perfect for me as I like trying lots of different dishes. We ordered a mix of veggie, fish & meat. Huge amount of choice on the menu. Each dish was delicious and left me wanting more! The dishes were tasty, with a perfect kick of spice but not overpowering. Hard to name a favourite but the grilled prawns, masala corn,sea bass curry, aloo firecracker and lamb cutlets were heavenly. Also had to mention our waiters and waitresses who were charming and attentive throughout the evening. I can’t believe I hadn’t discovered this gem of a restaurant before but I’ll definitely be back……."
166,"The rumours are true... this really is the best Indian restaurant in London. A wide array of tapas to choose from, each of them stunning (from what we tried: black dahl, truffle naan, chilli sheek kebab, chicken lollipops, tandoor mix). The truffle naan and chicken lollipops are a known favourite, but I'd really recommend checking out the black dahl too! The restaurant itself is lovely and clean, and the staff were beyond lovely. They checked in to make sure we were enjoying everything and were really on the ball making us feel at home. Will definitely be coming back!!"
167,"Had a couple of meat tapas plates and some cobras, couldn’t be more impressed with the service!!!! An incredible range of food all that which we tried we were blown away with!! Our two waiters were amazing and made sure our experience was a pleasant one from the get go. I can’t recommend or speak highly enough of Bonoos"
168,"Its first time in a london restaurant it was really really nice to feel with authentic Indian food service by Indian way. Well be back. We appreciate service by Vishal , amazing cocktails by bar man and a small chat with"
169,Friendly staff but multiple people approached us with the same questions. How did you hear about us? Where are you from? Why are you in London? It felt a bit try-hard and scripted. The place is cute-ish but I could do without giant plastic screens between the booths. Maybe someone else would like that? I’m so-so on fake flowers. There are clearly nice people working there and they care that you feel good as customers. The food was good but not spectacular. I wouldn’t return but I don’t have anything very bad to say about the place. It definitely isn’t a top top London restaurant in my opinion.
170,"A great restaurant!! Wonderful experience, great food and service. Highly recommend. The chef tastings meal is highly recommended"
171,"Can’t see all the fuss, food is average, found a fly (wasn’t in the food but felt worth mentioning.)"

180,"In London on a culinary trip and so far this is the best restaurant I've experienced. The food was amazing, the chicken melted in your mouth and the staff was very friendly. We were hosted by a girl named Dimpel and not only was she really nice but also not too pushy if you know what I mean as some servanta could be. So the Service was amazing and so was the food so in total it was a 10/10 experiencw :)"
181,"I’m usually very picky with my food but I literally have no bad to say about this place what so ever. The food 5/5 stars, the settings along with the staff were just brilliant!! Definitely will be back again!❤️❤️"
182,"This is the best Indian restaurant EVER (even from a New Yorker’s standpoint). The food was out of this world (must try the lamb chops, the mixed tandoori and the aubergine) The service was spectacular and the servers loved what they do and it showed! The restaurant is not centrally located and would require a tube ride but it is worth it. Will definitely repeat on my future trip. No wonder it got the #1 rating on Trip advisor out of 17,000 restaurants in London. Clearly a yummy!"
183,"Very good food, excellent service. The waiter kindly asked us if we wanted yogurt to help us in handling the spice better. Orange Bailey's at the end was a grand finish, I've asked the owner for the recipe!"
184,"The food here was absolutely delicious, as a family we ordered a bit of everything to try and we couldn't fault any dish. We cleaned everything and will be returning again soon. Very friendly environment and such an enjoyable experience. It's not every day that you can have a friendly laugh with your waitress and waiter. From the moment you are greeted till the very end you are treated with such kindness and care. A special thank you to Dimple who looked after us and made sure we were okay and happy with our meal. I would definitely recommend, an overall lovely meal and experience."

204,"This was our first visit to Bonoo Tapas and we loved it! We were greeted by friendly staff who made us feel welcome... we have visited many Indian restaurants and the food here is by far some of the best dishes we had in a long time.  The Gobi Manchurian, Black Dhal and Shabzi curry, for me, were the stars of the evening.  If you have the Gajar Halwa, be warned, you will want another... it is too good!  Above all, the staff could not be more friendly and welcoming... Dimple (and all of your colleagues), thank you so much for taking care of us. We really enjoyed your hospitality.  They have won us over and we'll happily make the trip to go back again."

218,"Had heard about Bonoo from a Facebook restaurant club, decided to take a friend for her Birthday and wow, it turned out to be the best decision. Decor is a really nice alternative to your 'usual' Indian restaurant but the real wow factor is the food and service, both impeccable and will see me going back soon to try other tasty items on the menu. They advise you to choose two dishes per person, but it's tough because all items look amazing; I chose 3 and whilst I couldn't quite eat it all (portions are generous), I'm glad to have tasted what I ordered and my dinner partner agreed that overall, it was amazing! Well done to the chef and staff, this restaurant is a must-visit for anyone who likes Indian food/spices. It was packed on a Saturday night, so note that booking in advance is advisable."

223,"Nice and delicous dinner with my friends and brother. Thanks for the baileys. We enjoyed the evening at yours. Yeren, Charleton, Pauli, Ivo and Francis."
224,"Really delicious food - we ordered 3 vegetarian curries, a fish curry and vegetable samosas and everything was perfect. Each dish had individual flavours and textures, and had all clearly been cooked freshly. I also had a passion fruit mocktail which was so refreshing. Last but not least, the service was excellent. Definitely recommend a visit here - you won't regret it!"
