1,@SunCity104_9FM receiving loud and and clear in chilly London- England#soundsperfect Hi to Queen Sheba and unique crew...
2,We booked through the Fork and had a discounted meal. Delicious and very filling food. Rashid was a great server.
3,"We were in London for a short break to celebrate my birthday and found we were only a ten minute walk away from Brick Lane. This means we had to have a curry on my birthday in Brick Lane, it’s the law you know. So looking at reviews online I picked Sheba as it had the highest score. As a bonus they are running a 50% off food offer, so sorted. They did charge a £6 service charge though. Anyway, the restaurant rang me to confirm the booking and a few hours later the wife and I rocked up to the front door to be greeted by a friendly chap who confirmed we were at the right place and showed us to our table. My wife after ten minutes or so wanted to move tables which was no bother at all to the staff. The staff were all friendly and even kept to my instruction of not singing ‘happy birthday’ to me, much to my relief, and possibly the other diners. My wife is a fussy eater and has a phobia about butter so has strict instructions about ‘no butter’ anywhere near her food. Sometimes her instructions can get lost in translation and many a time she has ran out of restaurants just at the mere smell of it, much to the puzzlement of staff. Luckily, on this occasion, her instructions were followed to a ‘T’ and no histrionics were needed. The food was lovely, I had prawns, my wife had chicken handy. The staff were attentive but not overbearing and the whole experience was very enjoyable. We would definitely return if in the area"
4,"We booked after reading the reviews on line and I'm glad we did as it was so busy. As we were walking to the restaurant we noticed that all the other curry houses nearby had very few customers (if any) but this place was rammed. Although it was super busy and somewhat chaotic we did get looked after by the waiters. Service maybe a bit slow but to be expected as it was so busy. We had mixed starters to share and then I had a madras which was great. A few beers later we were on our way. A good night, decent service and a great curry!"
5,Had a wonderful time with my family today at Sheba will recommend all my friends and family to go and try it I've been to a few in brick lane but Sheba is the one that stand's out
6,Great food. Delicious curry. Highly recommend. Very fresh and great service. Kids love it and we had a great time.
7,"I went there with my family to have lunch led by the google reviews. Turns out the food was flavorless, portions were too small (barely any protein in our curries, had literally 4 chicken “nuggets” in my chicken curry) and the service was the worst! Had to wait over an hour to get two curries. Turns out most of the reviews are fake! Prices where not cheap at all either. So ended up getting a flavorless, small and expensive lunch. Very disappointing! Stay away from this place"
8,"I loved the curries my wife and I ordered here. Just be careful of the items that have at least two peppers next to them — I can handle a lot of spice, and while the dish I had was delicious…it was HOT. Had two peppers next to it, just cannot remember the dish name; BUT, it was delicious, as was everything else we ordered.  But, what took a good experience to great was the hospitality shown by one of the managers, Shahid, who had a lovely convo with my wife and I before offering us complimentary shots of delicious liquor at the end of our meal. I’d highly recommend this place to anybody who wants delicious curries in the heart of Brick Lane."
9,"good food, nicely done. Tandoor chicken was moist and well done. Sheek kebab had great soices but a bit dry. Service was good and efficient. Chairs were pretty old and cracked, distracted from the crisp table linens. Toilets were pretty bad. Good experience though, nice surprise."
10,"I used to come here every Friday in the late 80’s, food is as excellent now as it was then, as was service (Rashid I think?..)"
11,Slow service and average food. Price was not worth it. The service was *far* too slow even when it wasn't that busy . I wouldn't recommend and won't be coming back
12,Highly recommend this wonderful restaurant. Chosen based on other reviews . Charming service and great selection for vegetarians. Also not oily and seriously tasty. Thanks I’ll be back
13,"Amazing downstairs room, amazing time with very nice service. Delivious food for a decent price. Recommand"
14,Been around the world and this is the best. Invited into the kitchen. Really nice people who loved their work and making people happy
15,"Absolutely amazing evening celebrating our anniversary. The food was incredible and the staff respectful, warm and friendly thank you so much ❤"
16,Went with my family on a recent trip and had an awesome experience! We enjoyed delicious food and had a wonderful time chatting and laughing with the staff. We were able to watch some soccer while we ate and had an incredible dining experience!
17,"I booked the restoran 4 weeks in advance through the Fork booking service for a party of 20 participating a medical educational meeting. At the beginning of the week of our planned visit to the restaurant I phoned 3 times to say that we would be up to 25. I last phoned 3 hours before coming to the restaurant and I was told it was not a problem and that my amendment was noted. When we arrived the restaurant was so full and still admitting people that there was absolutely no chance they could fit us in. They kept telling us to wait 10, 15 and then 20 minutes while all of us standing outside in the cold. After half an hour we left and went to another restaurant. All along I was being accused of being at fault for exceeding the original booking, even though I phoned many times and was assured that was not a problem. This restaurant would carelessly accept any booking in the full knowledge that it would exceed their capacity. This is so rude and careless. I would advise to avoid this establishment."
18,Excellent food. The staff are fantastic. Came for my friends birthday and we will 100% be back. The fact it is BYOB is even better.
19,Arrived at our large party booking to find our booking had not been taken correctly. What followed was a frantic scramble to find us an appropriately sized table with other large parties being sat ahead of us despite our party arriving earlier.  Eventually after much deliberation concerning where we would fit we were seated. Our food arrived 2 hours after we arrived to our booking. No issues with the food itself but the prior issues overshadowed the whole experience.  The restaurant is small and tables are moved to accommodate people resulting in a squished sardines affect.  There are people queuing outside therefore the door is constantly opened with the cold air hitting you each time. There are no baby change facilities either.  Overall despite best efforts to improve our experience I would not recommend this place and will not return.  It seems ok for after work meals or an off the cuff dinner if you are in the area and willing to wait but for a relaxing dinner not so.
20,"we went here because of the reviews and because of London's reputation for excellent curry. but the curry here was really bad. super sweet, minimal use of fresh peppers, lots of filler. it was the Indian equivalent of bad Chinese food. $6 Indian restaurants on 6th Street in Manhattan in the 80s. . they microwave the rice. even the mango Lassie was bad. don't believe the reviews."
21,"Best Indian in London, you've got to be joking! Mediocre at best. Uninspired, small portions, disinterested staff. Resting on their laurels."
22,If I could have put 0/5 I would have! Booked this restaurant for a special family occasion only to be told on arrival they had no reservation! So annoying after doing my research. Went next door and had a wonderful meal…
23,"Waited over an hour for food. Average at best upon arrival. Portions of meat very small, smothered in a more watery type sauce than one is used to. Very busy, staff stressed, maybe not a good time. May go back? But lovely area full of great restaurants. Plenty of choice."
24,"Wanting to offer an international group the authentic Brick Lane curry experience we chose Sheba from the reviews online. And we weren’t disappointed. Great food and excellent service (especially Kabir, what a gent!), plus a buzzy atmosphere. Everyone went home happy."
25,Amongst the best curries I’ve had in the UK. It’s a very busy curry house and that tells you everything you need to know. First class curries and friendly staff. Lots going on but you will definitely eat well. Homemade mango chutney with the popadoms is the best I’ve ever had.
26,Came here for a monthly social with 15 friends post university. We do this every month and this curry house was the best curry house we have been to since we started this monthly occasion. Rashid served us and delivered excellent service all evening. Great value for money for big groups
27,"Visited last night been waiting a few months after watching a few rave reviews on YouTube, friendly door staff gave us 20% off achohol card at the local shop ,this Resturant does not sell achohol.The Poppadoms tray was decent the starters were OK nothing too special ,the mains were a little dissapointing mine a Jelfrazi the onions were half cooked and the chicken wasn't as tender as I would like .another grape was the service charge was half -way up on the bill I actually missed it until my friend pointed it out .Wasn't awful but don't understand all the hype about this place had much better Indian Food at my local one."
28,Literally look no further! This is THE SPOT :) Food = 12/10 Service = 12/10 Curry was out of this world & I hope everyone can experience this food. @neeks93 on insta :)
29,I have never been to a curry house before that had no popadoms and no onion bhajis! Small portions and slow service. Apart from that all good.
30,"Marketed the ‘best curry house in London’. If this is best curry house in London, I’d love to see how bad the others are. Christ.  Three bits of chicken in my curry, naan was dead, drinks poured out of a two litre bottle from the Co-op round the corner… the waiter looked like he’d just found out his missus was cheating on him - face like a sour lemon.  Nice flavours - I will give them that. Then again, there are nice flavours in an M&S curry meal deal for two and at least I’d have enough sauce in that to dip my naan into.  Won’t be returning."
31,"Went for dinner based on the Time Out review. It was all delicious, raucous, and everything I wanted it to be. If you're looking for tasty, Bengali-British favorites in a casual, warm environment, come to Sheba."
32,Fantastic food and atmosphere! The staff was very friendly and lots of fun. Highly recommend the lamb tikka - best I’ve had!
33,I had planned a visit for weeks with my partner.We bought vouchers for the meal from Wowcher but when we arrived at restaurant they refused to honour them..an absolute disgrace of a company and legal action will be initiated
34,"Lovely place food was fantastic , good for money and staff were brilliant would definitely recommend !!! will be back myself."
35,my family arrived at the restaurant as reviews looked good. my curry lamb nagu arrived cold and very little sauce. the parathas looked and tasted as if they were deep fried. the food was horrible the waiter was not interested everything seemed to be a bother. 5 out of family were sick during the night. I would definitely not recommend this place.
36,Host/water was awful. Acted like we were a bother and was argumentative and as unfriendly as could be. Food was terrible as the house specialty lamb dish was all bone and grossed. We advised the host/water and his reply was that’s the way they get it. Avoid this place as there are many better options all around.
37,I originally booked the restaurant for 7pm on Thursday 4th August. I then called to change it to 7.30. I received confirmation AND somebody called me on Thursday morning to confirm reservation. All good. Or so I thought. The booking was made for a friends 60th birthday celebration who had never been to Brick Lane. We turned up at 7.30 and the restaurant was full. We were told to wait outside for half an hour and they would get us in. There are no seats outside and no offer of refreshment while we wait was made until I asked. They were too busy and just didn't care that despite confirmation that day they could not fit us in. We went to Aladin two doors away where the food and service were fantastic. Not sure how Sheba were awarded 'Best Curry House' if that's their don't care attitude!!
38,Absolutely 5 stars.Service was amazing - good was incredible and every last scrap of it. Loved the finishing touch of the free drink. Definitely going to become a regular and try every single thing on the menu - thanks :)
39,"I went there during our holiday as it was clise to our hotel. We had suleimani chicken and lamb saag , both were to die for. I really recommend it. I wish this restaurant was In Malta would be in my fav list"
40,I was a solo diner and these guys took such great care of me. Thank you for your amazing hospitality and delicious food!! <3
41,"Booked table in advance due to popularity! Lovely mixed starters, superb choice & range of curries to suit all palates. The Chicken Resala was absolutely delicious very tender & my hubby had King Prawn Malabar & this was equally delicious! Nice atmosphere, excellent service & staff polite & helpful would definitely go again! Many thanks Lindsay & Dean visiting from Scotland"
42,Visited here over the weekend i must say the food was lovely portion sizes were good and service was very good. If i had used the toilets before eating i would've walked out straight away is it really that difficult to put a lick of paint on a toilet door and some proper locks not botched up with bits of plywood. The stench smelt ingrained like they hadn't had a good clean in a long while i don't expect to lift up the toilet seat and see the back of the toilet backed up with yellow stains. If the toilets are like this how hygienic is the kitchen. I wouldn't visit here again which is a shame because the food was really good.
43,We booked for a table of 5 for a birthday gathering. The Table was in a great position. Service was excellent and the food was delicious. Waiters were helpful and attentive. They made us feel special especially the birthday girl.
44,Very tasty sheek kebab starter and good portions. Peshwari naan very good. Great service. Nice relaxing music. Would return again
45,No booking and were seated quickly service was super quick and the food touched the spot !! Definitely give it ago the prices were really reasonable ☺️
46,"Great food quick service BYOB which is great, perfect place to take the gals! Would defo come again quick bookings!"
47,"Food was amazing and service was quick. Recommend the saag paneer, it was delicious. Thank you! :) :)"
48,Very good food ! Very good services! Reasonable price. Thank you very much for warm welcome ! Congratulations for your family.
49,"Great experience! Easy to book online. Food was excellent. My 13 year old son & I are pescatariam and enjoy a fish curry.he had the Tandoori Salmon and I had Macher Tenga (tilapia fish). Fantastic food, great service. Highly recommended!"
50,"Very good price. Starter, main, rice and nnaan plus wine all included in the bill. Enjoyed the meal."
51,"Lovely curry on brick lane ! Had a chicken and a lamb dish and both were very tasty, can highlight reccomend"
52,"Service and food was excellent, we went for the first time for a birthday meal and will definitely be back"
53,Amazing food and great services! Byob was a lovely extra and made to feel very welcome. Deffo recommend!
54,"Fantastic food, even better service, would highly highly recommend this fine establishment. Friendly staff too!"
55,"Without a doubt the best curry house on the lane. And I’ve done my fair share of the rounds. Service was perfect. always looking after you with a smile on the face. Both curries were 10/10, nice and hot. wouldn’t even bother with the other curry houses here, Sheba’s got it down."
56,Had a wonderful time at sheba today with my friends it's was busy but the staff told us to wait for 5 minutes for a table and the was on time maybe 6 minutes but it was OK lovely food and always good service one of the owner he was a young man looked afters us very well
57,I visited with my good friend who loves Indian food. We ordered the Chicken Madras and Suleiman Chicken with pilau rice and it was delicious. Fantastic service also.
58,"This is our second visit from the US and on both visits (October 21 and May 22) we have eaten here and found the food to be delicious, the service to be top-notch and the prices to be very reasonable. Would come back in a heartbeat!"
59,"I have had a nice experience twice now at Sheba, both times great service and i returned after the amazing curry that I had the first time. And will come back a 3rd, the experiences in cuisine, professionalism, and ambience have all been worth returns."
60,"We had a great meal at Sheba, and were given great recommendations on what to order when we asked our server."
61,"We had a Friday lunch which was very nice, can't beleive it was so quiet, I think they get really busy during the evenings. Very attentive staff and couldn't have done more for us...... always nice to get a completementary drink thrown in as well! We will be back"
62,"Staff were very friendly, service was 10/10 . Food and presentation is emaculate and stunning, tasting as described. Definitely would go again and recommend others to visit."
63,Fantastic food and the service here is second to none. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended
64,"Friendly service and delicious food. Everything arrived at the same time and we all enjoyed all the dishes, fish, lamb and vegetables."
65,Just as good as next door. Pretty good for Brick Lane innit. Pistachio Ice Cream is very nice. The poppadoms are even better
66,"Delicious food, spiced very well Peshwari naan and pumpkin lentil curry were especially good Shah waited our table and was very polite and attentive Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants an amazing curry"
67,Visited this restaurant on a busy Saturday evening and ordered their Famous Bengal lobster special and I was not disappointed as it was just mouth watering and easily came off the shell.I have to say I waited about 35 minutes for it but it was worth the wait as it was just beautiful.  The restaurant is very popular and extremely busy and all the staff are very efficient and can’t do enough for you.  I would highly recommend going to this restaurant if you are in London and looking for top quality Asian cooking.  There were 2 of us dining and the bill was £44 ( no service charge)
68,"Mushroom rice is absolutely delicious and the staff were friendly. Very affordable, will come again for sure!"
69,"We called to see if the restaurant could accommodate a large party and they were extremely helpful. We were looked after very well, the food was delicious and the menu extensive. We’d certainly go there again."
70,Great food. Really tasty. Good range on the menu. Best peshwari naan I’ve ever had. Friendly and helpful staff. Thoroughly recommend
71,"I once lived near those tall glass buildings and I heard a city-boy telling another city-boy never to go beyond Middlesex Street to the east, that he wouldn't bring his wallet over there, where the buildings are again middle size and made of bricks. It utterly surprised me. I used to spend my days in those streets where the bricks on the walls don't let you see inside the homes, although those walls are more transparent than those of glass within The City.   Now, I live in a different place, but usually come to Brick Lane for food or anything else. In Sheba they take care of me, kindly, as its name already confirms that in Bengali. The rhythm is hectic in the street and around the tables: newcomers, big groups, romantic couples, kids. Waiters with the free first round of drinks or smoky plates in their hands running up and down. However, each table is immersed in its own bubble. The required quietness of the white cloth to enjoy each time the colorful masala or the crispness of the papadum, the sticky sponginess of the cheese naan drowned in green curry, the softness of the chicken tikka.  The TV was on that night, and although silent, the Bollywood scenes kept drawing the attention of my kids. After several calls, I gave up. So instead of a family dinner as I hoped, I ended up having a one to one with my wife. Like at home, nothing pretentious, with the transparency of the everyday."
72,"Visited Sheba in July 2021 while on holiday with my family. We’d purchased Groupon vouchers but I can honestly say that next time we’re in London, we’ll be eating here regardless of vouchers. The quality and value of the food is second to none and the owner is really friendly & chatty without being overbearing. It was our first time having Indian food in London and it definitely won’t be our last!"
73,Came for food with friends. The restaurant were more bothered about kicking us out and getting us to pay than anything. 2 football clubs in there and they had double booked so wanted out table. Had such a bad experience and they made us pay a £10 tip. Do not go here!!
74,I came here as part of a work group of 11 on a work Christmas party and were given the area downstairs. Staff were very good as was the food they were very understanding when we were a little noisy even creating our own karaoke party. Would recommend this restaurant.
75,"treated ourselves to two visits in a week whilst holidaying in London. Absolutely loved it, big thanks to Moe and his Uncle, look forward to seeing you when next in london. great food, warm hospitality, highly recommended, a must go to if you are hungry and any where near Brick Lane david and sue"
76,"Food was tasty; we had the madras lamb and saag lamb, mushroom rice and chilli cheese naan -the lamb was super soft. Flavours were lovely. Good service."
77,"Walked past Sheba in brick lane, a friendly man asked us if we were hungry! We were aiming for another we know but decided to try here instead for something different. We tried to chose a different main dish so went for a king prawn korai, the prawns were insanely big and juicy and fresh, the peshwari naan was lovely, chilli and garlic rice highly recommended and lovely big pieces of panner in the tikka started! Everyone really friendly and nice atmosphere."
78,"Got a voucher for this restaurant on Groupon for Starter, main and side for 2 people and the food was delicious and fresh. Would highly recommend."
79,Had a wonderful day out at sheba with my friends loved everything about it from food to service it was just perfect would recommend eayone to try it out
80,Went in a group on deal. Delicious food. Staff very friendly. Meal very tasty but not as hot/spice you as we are used to. Used to a Bradford curry
81,"The food was amazing! Such great value for money, everything was so delicious and the service was brilliant. We all enjoyed it so much."
82,"My friend and I received impeccable and super friendly service from the guys here. We were seated comfortably, intuitive recognition in an instant that I was not totally happy with the first table offered in spite of not saying a thing, Food was lovely and fresh, very tasty and we'll presented. My friend and I received extra complimentary chocolates too!! Great atmosphere, definitely be back."
83,Would not recomnend. Service was awful asked several times for drinks and only half the group were service. Staff too busy trying to pull people in off the street. Chicken was like rubber sauce coukd have been out a jar.
84,I enjoyed my experience and they are very friendly and clean. Honestly it's in a class of their own. MUST TRY
85,"Visited for a business trip, a fantastic service, great price and amazing food, I highly recommended. Would visit again!!"
86,"Sheba is a good place to eat and enjoy excellent Indian cuisine. I first visited here in July and it was so good I returned this weekend on September 11th for another fantastic meal. The staff are brilliant with and look after you very well. Thanks to Jimmie who enticed us in whilst walking along brick lane when we were wondering where to eat on a wet July evening. He said the food and service would be good and he wasn’t wrong. It’s absolutely superb, when I tasted the lime pickle at the start I knew I was in for a treat! I’m looking forward to seeing everyone again soon at Sheba for another enjoyable meal & visit. Many thanks to everyone for looking after us so well. Best wishes Rufus."
87,"Genuinely the best curry I've had in a long time. The food, vibe and service was ace. The team catered for a large group and everything was perfect. Good curry and good people. Will be back very soon thanks team. Thanks for making the birthday so special."
88,"Group of 12 for a birthday, great table, so welcoming and looked after us really well. Food was top notch, and the team went above and beyond to make sure it was a great birthday."
89,It's a long time since I have visited Brick Lane and the many Asian restaurants on offer. We were in London recently and decided we would visit again. The host of Sheba was so welcoming and so in tune with the sort of meal we wanted. The menu was very extensive containing a very large number of dishes I've never heard of before. There were four of us. We didn't leave a single grain of rice - it was all simply superb. I will most certainly be back. I strongly recommend it.
90,"Great customer service and the food was lovely. The vegetable curry was the highlight for me, would definitely go back for that!"
91,"Came here as a group of 7. Curry’s were amazing the lamb saag was a highlight. Tried the Bollywood blast, which was spicy but very very tasty. Coffee had cream with it which we particularly enjoyed.  The waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. Fantastic start to the weekend.  Would definitely come again. 10/10 would recommend."
92,"The best customer experience. You won’t get better on brick lane! Really nice atmosphere and a nice place to spend an evening. Good food, affordable drinks, great price."
93,Had a wonderful time with my family had good food and good service. I had lamb shanks my wife had king prawn tawa The place was buzzing with a good vibe and the atmosphere was wonderful the service was so good I will definitely go back again to sheba and recommend to all Mt friends and family.
94,"Came in here on the off chance whilst walking down brick lane for a friends birthday. Really nice food, reasonable prices, good service and gave my friend a complimentary drink as it was her birthday. Will be back."
95,"I shared a fantastic meal here with my 17 year old in June. We had actually bought a groupon voucher so, in all honesty, weren't expecting much choice, but the variety was fantastic and the food was delicious. Even without a really good deal I was absolutely eat here again - without a doubt"
96,"Absolutely loved shebas, me and my partner came tonight (13th July) and the food was sublime, fantastic value, and the customer service was second to none.. Would highly recommend.. And will definitely be back"
97,Love this restaurant. The staff are always friendly and the food is always very good. It’s my must go to place when I’m in the area.
98,"We had a fabulous meal. Authentic, delicious fresh food. The service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. It was a quiet night in the restaurant as it was the UEFA semi final but this did not detract from the experience. Would highly recommend"
99,One of the best Indian meals we’ve ever had. We’re foodies and love Indian cuisine. The food at Sheba was outstanding. Due to the Euro semi-finals we were the only diners in the restaurant. The service was charming and delightful. The food was deliciously spicy without being too hot.
100,"The best indian place we’ve found on The Fork. Bricklane location, the curry is gorgeous, there are lots of flavours. Thank you!"
101,"The staff were lovely, friendly and accommodating. And the food was some of the best we have ever had. Can’t recommend this restaurant enough!"
102,"Had some Groupon vouchers for this restaurant, wasn't expecting much as it didn't cost the earth, however from the moment you get through the door the service is great, they couldn't be helpful enough, especially as we arrived late, great selection of food from set menu, cobra beer on tap, a must at all Indian restaurants, it got busy as the evening went on but the service didn't falter. If you want a nice surprise, go visit, I'll be going back in July."
103,Top notch food with a class atmosphere and friendly service! Shah made sure our food was fast and our cups were full throughout our visit.
104,"Had a meal here today, 4 of us and my little boy. Was very well catered for and looked after. Food was outstanding. Thank you :)"
105,Quality meal. Shout out to Shah for excellent service Fantastic atmosphere and great vibes all around
106,"First off. The picture you see on TripAdvisor is nothing like the actual restaurant. It's not bright, clean and sparkling as shown.  We went as a gift ""experience"" and wouldn't eve come back.  We were sat by the far end which was initially a laptop office which was hurriedly cleared and as such was busy with noise from waiters and staff.  The table had a bottle of water on it but we had to ask for glasses. Later, we found out that this was chargeable. We never asked for it and it was £9 including 1 Kingfisher so I would estimate £3-4 for a bottle of warm still water.  Not a great start.  The floor bounces so you feel every step as the service moves up and down.  The tikka starter lacked any real freshness and flavour and the main was OK.  Noway worth £59 and one to avoid.  As for the food. We were never asked how"
107,"Really can't recommend highly enough. Best poppadoms and pickles I've had in a long time, then we all TOTALLY LOVED our mains - all different and all equally gorgeous and yummy. Shah looked after us and was amazing, totally on the ball and always one step ahead of us and our needs. Seriously can not recommend highly enough ❤"
108,They really took care of me and my mum and gave us amazing deals. Must recommend to everyone. Food was amazing and the hospitality is 5*
109,"Amazing food, great service and lovely atmosphere! Very attentive people and helpful New local curry place,"
110,"One of the best Indian meals I have ever had. The Nawabi Lamb Shank was superb, it had so much flavour and the lamb fell off the bone. Mushroom rice and sag aloo also excellent. The service was friendly and professional."
111,Went for a family meal I must say the food was amazing our children's enjoyed the food as much as we did. We will for sure go back. Most importantly the customer service was above all. Highly recommend.
112,Went out to Brick Lane for a meal with family and ended up in Sheba restaurant. The food was exemplary as well as the service.. highly recommend this place. Thank you Sheba stuff for looking after us.
113,We had a warm welcome to this friendly traditional place with nice polite staff and good value delicious food. The lamb saag was excellent as was the tandoori chicken..... beer reasonably priced too..... please give them a try now they are reopened . You wont be disapointed! ( Social distanced tables all in order here too!)
114,"Sheba is one of the best indian restaurants in Brick Lane, I decided to eat something at Sheba with some friends due to its good reviews here.  It is not a big place, I reckon it has the space for about 30 people.  I found the service quite quick and I thought the curry and the paneer were pretty tasty and well cooked.  The waiters were professional but I did not like their push to "" send us at home"" due to restaurant closure, but 30 mins before the closure.  Overall, I reckon it is definitely more of quantity over quality and the price was very good for the food, service and location."
115,5 star food and service Warm welcome Clean environment I go there often with my wife Highly recommended
116,"we visited on a busy saturday night though maybe all saturdays are busy. young exuberant crowd. food was good - subtle, not overwhelmimg but beware, their rating of spice-ness is more accurate than most - I went for a two chilli rating - and it was at least that,but delicious. all of us were very happy with our meals."
117,Greeted with poppadoms and chutney plate. Friendly staff and great portions. A round of shots on the house at the end. Not rushed allowed to take our time and relax. Would recommend for groups wanting to take their time and watch the day go by.
118,we visited using a groupon and received great service and really enjoyed the food. staff very polite and made us feel welcome.
119,"I had an amazing dinner at Sheba with my dad just now. Amazing food, lovely waiters. The only minus was the loud music."
120,"My husband and I were in London to celebrate his 40th birthday. We met up with our local friend and returned to this Brick Lane restaurant 4 years since our last visit. The food was still delicious, decent service, and decent prices. The portion sizes seemed a bit smaller than our previous visit but the quality and taste was still outstanding. Butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and samosas were some of our favourties."
121,Just left this restaurant only went based on reviews and the fact that if you have a full paying guest the birthday person gets a free 3 course meal well this is not true as u get a starter main and they say your rice is the 3rd course iv never heard thos before n 25 years of visiting Indian restaurants also when you let them know you have your voucher they look at you like they have no idea what ur talking about. Also u can not buy individual items it's all based on 1 course £16.95 even children and 2 courses £19.95 Very decieving restaurant food was very basic would not go back jave had better from my local take away bhaji isle of dogs. Wen I asked for the 3rd course he said it was the rice. But as you will see from my recipet he put 2 course birthday meal. Very disappointed do not waste your time as if u walk.down brick lane you will get better deals and great tasting restaurants. I highly respect a place called Khans in bayswater absolutely beautiful food but not great service but the food is amazing
122,Booked this restraunt upon genuine feedback from work colleagues who have visited this restraunt.Turned out to be exact as recommended. Booking service was very welcoming restraunt hasa very pleasant atmosphere food was was amazing shohid was a very helpful waiter aswell thank you guys definitely will recommend you
123,"I lived in Birmingham for four years and ate curries almost every week but I think this was actually the best curry I've ever eaten. So much flavour, very good price and very decent portions. The staff were friendly, polite and accommodating too. If I'm ever back on Brick Lane this will be my curry house of choice!"
124,"Down Brick Lane there are plenty of places all boasting awards of some kind but I first went by ratings on Google maps, then noticed this was one of the few places that responded to reviews on Google, so I made it a point of visiting there.  It's not a big place (sufficient space for about 30 diners, I'd guess) but was quite busy with plenty of staff on standby, being attentive. Some Bollywood played on the TV with the soundtrack piped into the overhead speakers for ambience, but the volume wasn't overly loud. There seemed to be a downstairs but wasn't marked for seating.  I found the service quite a quick turnaround - I ordered a Jal Frezie with nan and a Cobra and didn't have long to wait. I thought the curry was pretty tasty, having a nice thick sauce and just the right amount of kick, but there wasn't a great deal of it for the price.  Overall, it's definitely more of the ""quality over quantity"" and I'll be visiting this place again."
125,"Went for a Christmas gathering with friends, portions were very small, for example, ordered a chilli paneer dish which has four small cubes of paneer and nothing else cost was £7..! The chilli paneer was completely unreasonable in the level of chilli - and I can tolerate my spice very well. Food was okay, BYOB is good but everywhere on brick lane does that. Service was good but 20% compulsory service charge is pretty high. Won't return but not a bad experience. Just know there's better available"
126,"A group of 28 of us came here for our team Christmas meal. The service is really good, they went above and beyond for us and the food was excellent. Reasonable prices. I would definitely reccommend this restaurant."
127,"Two of us ate here and we were really disappointed. The starters were dry and bland, both curries tasted the same - the best bit was the naan bread (but still didn’t make up for the rest of the meal) The service also wasn’t great. We were in line with the door and had to keep getting up and closing it because every 5 minutes or so staff would wander in and out (letting a very cold breeze in every time) and would leave the door open which is pretty rude in the middle of winter. We won’t be returning and next time we’re around the brick lane area will definitely try somewhere different for a better experience."
128,Neatly 2 hours sat waiting. Friends had eatten and left before some meals were served. The food tastes ok but not if you want to eat together.
129,"Absolute amazing, this has to the finest indian restaurant, the mouthwatering dishes and thick luscious sauce in there currys. Was worried if the curries would taste same like most indian restaurant but each curry we ordered tasted very different to each other, the Lamb Bunah Naga,Chicken Xacuti, to die for Bengal Lamb Shank, King Prawn Malabar,these are the must tries. Excellent atmosphere, there was few large groups like ourselves, still food came piping hot on time, excellent service."
130,The service and friendly welcome I got was absolutely amazing I went there for my birthday dinner and really enjoyed it the food was mouthwatering and will recommend everyone to go there with friends family
131,"I have dined at Brick Lane curry houses numerous times and this was by far the most disappointing experience I've had - and to be completely honest, one of the worst dining out experiences I've had anywhere. The man outside whose job it was to lure in customers offered us a set price, which included two drinks (there were four of us eating together, all of whom could verify this). When we asked for our second drink, we were told quite forcefully by our waiter that the deal only included one drink. When we protested, explaining that his colleague outside promised two as part of the deal, he again very aggressively denied this would have ever been offered. Two of us went outside to clarify with the guy on the sidewalk, when the waiter barged out after us and continued to deny that has had been offered - I should add that he was getting extremely angry and threatening at this point. The sidewalk man then came over to our table and said that he'd only offered us one drink (lying blatantly to our faces) but would give as an additional one as an act of goodwill. At this point there were about four members of staff fighting loudly about this, which made the dining experience uncomfortable to say the least. When it came time to pay they added a ""service charge"" on to the bill, which we could only assume was to cover the cost of the additional round of drinks. Our waiter then hovered over us as we put down our money and counted it out on the table in front of us. We left feeling completely put off to say the least. In addition to the blatant lying and aggression, there were many other unsavory components to our dining experience. The toilets were absolutely disgusting and had rat droppings on the floor. The food was subpar at best - though to be fair, one doesn't go to a brick lane curry house for an exceptional meal. We also had extremely rude and lax service, even before the altercation about the drinks. There are many curry houses on Brick Lane, and I would recommend trying any of them before this one."
132,"speechless, food was amazing and delicious. Spicy and cooked to perfection just how I like it. The curry and naan bread were a perfect combo. Mmmmhhhh. The staff were all so kind and welcoming to me and my friends. 😄😄 would definitely recommend. 100%"
133,I visited this restaurant with my daughter and my grandkids very beautiful place and service but the food is horrible
134,Im a regular diner on brick lane but recently ive been visiting this gem a few times sheba serves the best dishes by far to others the service is as always amazing absolutely faboulase prawn dishes aswell. Keep it up guys see you soon.
135,"flFood was really good and couldn't be faulted. Unfortunately customer service is poor and I wouldn't recommend coming here. I came with a Groupon voucher hoping to come back another time if I enjoyed it - but this was not the case. They throw your plate of food onto the table, not bothering to actually hand it out to the individual person but instead leave everything onto the side of the table. Just generally rude."
136,"with brick lane being on the ""tourist route"" , plus it being a road full of curry houses that would possibly cater for customers that they would never see again , we were not expecting anything special. how wrong we were ! - the restaurant was clean ,tidy comfortable with white tablecloths on all the tables . although the menu was very reasonably priced , the staff were most efficiant , the portions were most generous and the quality of the food was superb , there is no doubt when we are in brick lane again , we will walk past all the other restaurants touting for business and head for ""SHEBA"""
137,Family dinner but sat next to very loud crowd--waiter should have known better--however food was very good and service ok and price reasonable
138,"Booked for early evening on a Friday and place was basically dead but upper level soon filled up by 7.30. I wouldn’t wanted to have been in the large dining area which was empty. That said this gave the manager time to carry on with cleaning light fittings etc in what was a nice area. We’d booked and “negotiated” a discount. As per Brick Lane practice there was plenty of “negotiations” going on outside where you could make your own deal. Just make sure that you clarify exactly what you are being offered as the goal posts may change once you are attracted in! We found that our discount was only to be applied only to main dishes and not sundries. We’d expected it to be off the total bill. Heard another group complaining that they’d been offered “large” beers outside but were served small bottles. Couldn’t fault the staff, food nor service - all very good and we enjoyed the visit. Generous portions and nicely chilled beer added to the experience. Would certainly return. Denied 5 stars as my wife wasn’t entirely content with the cleanliness of “the ladies”."
139,"Lovely food, lovely service. Would definitely come again. Right in the heart of brick lane - what more could you ask for!"
140,The food was cooked to perfection. Amazing service from the waiters. The food was mouth watering and delicious to eat. Would defiantly recommend to those who enjoy Indian. Perfect way to end the night with a nice curry.
141,"5 family members celebrating Nick’s birthday. Good food, varied menu ( we had a vegan with us) and didn’t cost a fortune. Very p,easant staff, we’ll be back!"
142,"a friend had booked a very large table of about 16 people one evening, the menu was set so the cheapest option was roughly £17 minumum spend, which as a student is quite a lot. when they came and took our orders, they were incredibly demanding/ rude and said me and a friend could not share one curry as we had booked specifically for 16 people so MUST have 16 meals, which i thought was very stingy and ridiculous seeing as they were going to make a lot of money from a 16 person booking as it was! When my chicken korma curry arrived, it was very plain and average, like a very cheap takeaway. The whole experience seemed like a waste of time and a waste of money."
143,"Honestly I wasn’t expecting to be wow’d, but this place was delicious! We ordered the saag paneer (maybe the best I’ve ever had), lamb buhna naga, special tandoori king prawns korai, and the spicy daakaubergine special. Would 100% order again. We had such a great time with amazing food and excellent service. Will definitely come again!"
144,Me and a friend came across the restaurant on a whim and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was tasty and the service was great!
145,Booked a table for 5 for lunch the food was amazing my boss absolutely loved it and so did the rest of us The service was very attentive during our Visit got to you guys really dud amaze us thanks very much sheba will see you soon
146,My girlfriend loves your places we shall be back! Abbas was a very good server we hope he is here when we return!
147,"This restraunt is situated at the far end of bricklane as me and my husband out on a quite stroll on bricklane on a Monday night.for a Monday night sheba was full beaming with eagerly waiting customers,the place was pact when we arrived we got a seat downstairs which had amazing deco. The food was recommended by abbas the shorisha chicken full of flavours service was very attentive by our waiter ABBAS.All round this restraunt is a winner thank you guys and thanks ABBAS"
148,"This is possibly the best Jalfrezi I have had...ever! Have had regular Bradford curries, Manchester curry mile, home cooked too 😋😋😋"
149,Booked this restraunt for my 30th birthday party.Dont know were to start the compliments upon arrival we was very politely recieved and escorted to our table because it was our first time they helped recommend us with their best dishes thoroughly enjoyed the meal every last bit of it the atmosphere was amazing with Melodious music this restraunt is an absolute gem definitely recommend this place they also have a beautiful lounge downstairs will be visiting soon thanks guys
150,This the best gem of bricklane booked a table for 8 as a family reunion.When we arrived we was very politely recieved and guided to our table the food and drink was unquestionable with a doubt.Definetly a must visit restraunt on brick lane thank you so much guys and thank you sabbir
151,"Came here with my fiancé after hearing how famous brick lane is for curry. We paid particular attention to the hygiene ratings and decided to go to Sheba as it had 5 stars for its hygiene rating (ironically!).  The curry tasted nice (though a bit too artificially red looking) and I was enjoying til I found I bit down on something hard within the chicken piece. I thought it was a bit of bone however discovered it was a sharp shard of plastic about 2cm long. When I said to the staff member that I found this within the curry, he just said “oh”. I was completely appalled. No apology.  If this happened back home in Glasgow, where the curry clearly is far superior to brick lane (actually any meal I have gone for in my life has not had a chunk of hard plastic in it), we would have at least had an apology if not the meal on the house or a drink!  My advice would be to avoid this place unless you fancy some unknown entities in your curry!"
152,"We went for my husband’s birthday and the staff were incredibly welcoming and accommodating (to the point of adding two extra guests an hour into the meal, saying “that’s no problem”. The food was delicious and the service was really attentive. The price was really reasonable as well."
153,If you love curry this is a very good destination in Brick Lane . The service was excellent all the staff were very attentive and very helpful. The prices were very reasonable and very good value for money and the food was very good full of flavor and delivered the curry experience .
154,"I went to this restaurant this weekend just gone for my 30th birthday. The food was absolutely stunning. Some of the best food I have tasted. The staff were incredible, very attentive and funny. They even gave me a birthday desert with a candle and sang me happy birthday and gave us a free shot at the end of our meal. I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant if you are visiting nearby. I will 100% be returning!"
155,"We went as a 2 friends with of 2 teenagers. Mango lassi was nice, Fish Boal was amazing, samosas were great, the 4 chicken dishes were really tasty. Staff were so lovely."
156,Second time I’ve been back to Sheba as it’s one of the best curry houses in brick lane! Also you can bring your own alcohol which is a good bonus. Prices are not expensive at all and service is good.
157,Stumbled upon Sheba when looking for a curry on Brick Lane and was so impressed with the food and the service. Definitely worth a visit
158,"Had a very warm welcome and delish dinner here. Staff were really friendly from start to finish. I had the tikka masala - beautiful! Excellent value for money too, will definitely be returning 🙂"
159,"Lovely time - great food, really enjoyed the mains. Also delicious starters and the wine. Thank you 😊"
160,Brought my buddy to brick lane and stumbled across Sheba. Excellent food and great service. I will definitely be coming back!
161,"Food was amazing, service was amazing. Abbas, Shah, Sabbil were very good to us, giving the best service and very high energy. Deffo recommend, will be coming back!"
162,"Okey doke so I've read some mediocre reviews of Sheba on this site but in no way does that compare with the experience I've just had (6 Jul 19).  My wife and I had a late lunch at Sheba and the quality of the food, and service, was without fault.  The host recommended suitable combinations and then even provided free dips to complement our choices. The portions were more than large and the flavour...wow!  The lamb naga was simply extraordinary. How they get that depth of flavour into a meal is simply beyond me.  I had the chicken with black chili and again, nothing like anything I've had before.  In summary, go for it. Absolutely outstanding."
163,Like curry from the supermarket tasty yes but not worthy of a restaurant. We ordered a chicken curry leaf and a lamb rogan. I blind tasted the sauce without meat and struggled to tell the difference. The mixed kebab was also disappointing. This poor quality seems to be normal on brick lane. If you know a good one please let me know
164,"Food brilliant as usual but the welcome by the Maitre d was so surly, did not crack a smile, the rest of the staff superb though."
165,Amazing food and excellent service. Ask for the naga pickle! First time here and won’t be the last definitely!
166,"We visited Sheba for my friend’s stag party. I had the Chicken Xacuti and it was great, perfect blend of spice and flavour. The staff were really friendly and helpful, and after my friend failed to finish the spiciest meal on the menu (he ordered it despite being advised of its hotness by the manager) he was given a jar of Naga Pickle as a commiseration. Absolutely great, would highly recommend."
167,"Went on a stag do. Food is really good. Do not recommend the Bollywood Blast, our friend was not hard enough. The Bengali chicken and the Hydrabadi chicken were great though. Bless them, they gave our friend a consolation jar of pickled chillies for failing to eat the Bollywood Blast."
168,"Great food, great service, great night, zero corkage. We had a great night on a double date. The food was brilliant and the service was brilliant."
169,"If you are looking for a BYO, here is the place to go. Sheeba is the place for a good butter chicken don’t go to Kentucky fried chicken. This is the place where you get a deal, take a step to the right of you want a better meal."
170,"Food not worth that money of the amount of food and taste which too far from Indian taste, my husband told that my biriani and curry much better and flavour like Indian"
171,"Went to the restaurant last night. Really good atmosphere, very friendly staff. Food was superb. Will definitely visit again. A great evening."
172,"Just finished my meal here absolutely delicious , great service , Abbas was very attentive I would recommend this place very highly and will be coming back . A real Gem of a place in Brick lane !"
173,"Took my other half here for his 50th as he’d never been to brick lane for a curry. The lamb shank is out of this world and highly recommended. We also had prawn korma, mixed meat starter and okra. Will definitely be going back"
174,"We have wanted to eat at one of the restaurants on Brick Lane for sometime so didn't want to go just anywhere, we read the reviews and opted for Sheba and it was excellent. We were tempted in at the door with the offer of a beer and a 20% discount which was an added bonus. The staff welcomed us and we were served swiftly. We ordered the popadoms to start and then a lamb rogan josh and chicken bhuna both curries were delicious, we also ordered rice and garlic naan to share, both were smaller than usual restaurants but absolutely superb, if you have a large appetite I would order one each. The value of the meal was great at £33 including our discount, we also ordered two further drinks. We will most definitely be back."
175,We had a nice meal here last night. Food is good and the service is to be commended. However there was a table of around eight people that just took over the place. The volume was horrendous. It was only when we were leaving that one of the staff told them to keep the noise down. Ruined our Friday night meal out. So maybe don’t go on a Friday if that isn’t your thing.
176,We did a groupon deal at this restaurant whilst visiting London the food was very good loved the sheesh kebab and the drinks are reasonably priced i would have scored a 5 but the toilets need to be improved finally the service from our waiter was excellent and I would definitely use this restuarant again as the menu prices are reasonably priced
177,Really enjoyed the meal work all over the country and this is one of the best I’ve been to see again soon. Oh great deals.
178,We visited on a Sunday evening and it was fairly busy and I would suggest booking in advance. Lovely menu and we were very pleased with our food. Lots of room for diners but I would suggest some work to the downstairs toilets as a little dated but other than that Sheba is a treat and worth a visit.
179,"Great food, got a deal from the promoter outside to come in, it’s worth a try! Atmosphere and staff got friendlier as evening went on and food was delicious. Nice beer 👍🏼🍺 Order plenty ! Thanks"
180,"Went for my birthday lunch with some of the work girls - booked the table in advance and they were very accomodating. Got to the venue, and their service from point one was great. The range of food options was also immense and the food that we ordered was divine! They also surprised me with a birthday ice cream. Did not see that one coming. Price is amazing - deffo give them a try.  Thank you so much and see you soon. Rupa"
181,"What can I say food is fantastic, very friendly restaurant been a couple of times ,definitely a must"
182,We had an excellent meal here this evening and the customer service was fantastic. The waiters made time to talk to and joke with our young son. A thoroughly enjoyable evening.
183,"Me my wife and daughter all visited last weekend. The food and service was first class even though the place was packed the staff still took time to make us feel welcome. We can’t wait to get back, highly recommended. The Tandoori mixed grill, popadoms/pickles are a must."
184,"Shah and his team went above and beyond. Bought on groupon, would definitely visit again. Recommend lovely dishes. Can’t wait to come back."
185,"Booked a table on a busy Friday night with my girlfriend,the restraunt was packed out, the smell of the spices was absolutely amazing. The food was excellent, service was quick and the waiter who served us was very friendly. Will visit again. Thank you SHEBA."
186,"The only thing going for this place is the staff. They were legends. However, it's an establishment that is frankly tired and rubbish!  We went on a GroupOn deal and it was still terrible. My menu wouldn't open because there was all gunk stuck to it! I was appalled and I am lost for words. Also, the house wine you get with the GroupOn deal is like petrol!!!  Avoid. You have been warned!!!"
187,We were unlucky enough to stumble across this restaurant last Friday. I can’t Comment on the the food as we only ordered a starter and a drink and promptly left the restaurant as it stunk very badly of pee. The toilets are located downstairs at the back of the restaurant and we were at the front of the restaurant upstairs.
188,Ate here as a group of eight on a Friday night in December with three of us being visitors from a far off land. The walk down Brick Lane through the numerous restaurant touts was good fun - somewhat like Marrakech and Dubai spice markets. Politely ignoring their pleas to grace their fine establishments is the way to go. Not sure why this particular eatery had been chosen although I see it has won various awards over the years. Food was nice and for me just right as I didn't break out into buckets of sweat like a hot curry does to me. Extensive menu. A satisfactory but not spectacular eat out - hence 3/5 rating. Good service.
189,"Visited Sheba to meet with friends. Found the food to be okay but overpriced - I'd expect more polite staff and less overcrowding for what they charge.  My poppadums and chutney were actually taken away from me before finishing them despite physically eating.... I have a broken arm so yes it takes a little longer!! The waiter told me my main was ready when he was taking my plate if food away which i had paid for. After about 70 mins, we were asked to leave and vacate the table despite there being others available. I was ill for the majority of the next day too so all of that hassle wasn't worth it. Will not be returning or recommending to friends."
190,"I have been to this restaurant a few times now and always been very happy with both the food and service. The korma is super, the naan delicious. There is a mango korma dish on the menu which is the best thing I have had in an Indian restaurant anywhere in the world. The only dish they could improve on is the spinach paneer. I will be back again and again."
191,"Went in and not much of an introduction. Seemed like they couldn’t be bothered lunch 1pm Saturday. Service then picked up a bit.  Chicken korma isn’t great. The worse thing was the basmati rice. Clearly reused and microwaved. It was clumpy and tasted stale. Not fluffy at all. Rice can be dangerous if reheated too.  Had to reuse cutlery between starter and main. When we were leaving 3 American people walked in and they were asked if they had booked.....the place was empty.  This is a Bangladeshi restaurant not Indian. The staff had Indian accents throughout the service and had east end London accents when we left. It didn’t actually work on someone who grew up in the east end of London, me."
192,"Great menu with wide choice of traditional dishes, and some of their own specialities. The service was friendly, fast and attentive. the food was tasty, presented well, and plenty of it. And, good value for money. One of the best curry houses I've been to."
193,We ate here on a Sunday evening and would highly recommend it. We’d already been told they had a BYO policy which was great - no corkage fee either.  There’s a big selection of starters and curry. We went for the lamb kebab and chicken pakora - both were really tasty. We then had the chicken saag and the garlic chicken bhuna - would definitely have both these again!  What made the evening even better value for money was being able to use the Meetkat Meals offer (starters and main meals 241 on certain days!)  Definitely worth checking out if you’re after a tasty curry in London!
194,Wandered down here. Got blown away by brick lane. Just go and absorb the day and the shops. And the street food. Etc!
195,disturbing guests with screams...... never again . Maybe when they get new chefs . But i Really regret
196,Went for a family meal what a amazing night it was the place was a very comfatable setting with heaps of people the food was very tasty and indulgent loved the accuracy of the sevice great drinks aswell the einner of the show was the rezalla chicken quality without a doubt definitely sheba is the winner in town highly recommendable.Thanks guys see yiu soon
197,"Delicious Indian food, clean restaurant, very friendly staff!! We will definitely return when we come back to London. Greetings from The Netherlands"
198,"So Brick Lane is famous for it's curries and we hadn't been to this one. Service was decent, staff friendly enough, price ok... but both my wife and I were ill afterwards. I had the Tandoori mixed grill which was delicious but on leaving, before I had got to the top of Brick Lane I realised I needed the toilet pretty darn quick. My wife had a vegetarian curry and made it back to our home about an hour away before being violently sick. The toilets weren't very clean and maybe the hygiene isn't good - don't know. But we won't be returning."
199,"Food great, service great but a bit of confusion with the bill but the manager sorted it so all in all nice visit, Bollywood blast is awesome if you like hot food"
200,"Came here on a Saturday night with my partner. We were reeled in by the 20% discount plus first round of drinks free offer. The service was fantastic, they were attentive and loved that they provided warm hand towels after dinner. The food was ok. We got the butter chicken korma and the lamb chop curry. The butter chicken was very average, not a lot of depth to the flavours. The lamb chop was tasty but I think it needed more protein in the dish itself. There were only three cutlets to share. All in all, it was an ok experience."
201,the food is very very good and the service excellent. the waiter that served us was very friendly and professional
202,Very good meal- quiet and comfortable - very good service - yet another master chef of Bricklane winner - I think they nearly all are! A very good choice.
203,"Went here for lunch when visiting Brick Lane as it had been recommended to us. It's the only Indian restaurant I've been in that hasn't offered poppadoms when looking through the menu - although the table of 4 that came in after us were offered straight away. Food arrived promptly and was average ,we weren't asked if everything was alright again the table of 4 was?? We had ordered a bottle of wine with our meal and spent approx £60 but weren't made to feel welcome at all, disappointed we had really been looking forward to this. Even though my husband mentioned that we weren't offered poppadoms although every other restaurant we visited in the past has but the staff weren't interested."
204,Went through the usual firing line of shop front offers.. decided in this. 20% plus first free beer.. food was OK and free beer was a half pint. Was empty on arrival at 6:30 but soon filled up.. bit of a rushed serve and clear and they certainly wanted the table.. 5 rating on the hygiene site so that was a big plus. Would I go again.. probably
205,Had heard this was one of the best. found the food was average at most. Not much taste at all. Samosa was so squashed it looked like it had been sat on. Curries were tasteless. Edible but nothing special
206,"really good food, and plenty of good veggie options. the waiter who whipped our plates away while we were still eating was the downside though. we had to ask him to leave us alone as the one person trying to eat was being stalked by waiters giving us hot towells. the place was only 1/2 full so they didn't need the table."
207,"This restaurant was one of my favorite food, the food is so delicious, lovely staff, quiet an atmosphere and great services, I recommend all people who like Indian food to try this one."
208,"We chose it by chance, but were extremely happy with our choice. Food is very very good and the service excellent. Really happy with Sheba!"
209,"Brick lane is a must to see, the atmosphere and the aroma of the curry houses is terrific.  The restaurant owners become you in with various deals all of which are generous.  Starter, main, side, nan and drinks for less than £18 all good.  Excellent service, food and presentation well worth visiting."
210,My Wife and and I came for Dinner this evening and it was great food and great service as ever. I had the very hot Bollywood Blast which was exceptional as ever. My Wife Had a Milder Bhuna and really enjoyed the food and her first time at Sheba. We live in London but have also lived in many parts of the U.K and can honestly say that Sheba is the place I have visited in the U.K. for a curry. If you are in London looking for a fantastic curry visit Sheba on Brick Lane and you will really enjoy the food.
211,The taste of the food was amazing. I have had the same dishes elsewhere this restaurant made them in the best way possible.
212,"Good service, thanks for the nice discount on a dinner for two. Great curries, naan and appetizers for starters."
213,"Really good cheap food. Bargains on the street- we got a starter, main, poppadom and 2 glasses of drink each for a tenner. Don’t be afraid to ask for it cheaper on the street. Good selection of good quality food."
214,"Lovely meal, gave us a two course offer for 5 of us. The service was nothing short of amazing and the food came promptly, and was exceptional. Would highly recommend it."

218,"Going to London and brick lane, it's like a lucky dip, you never know if you are going to a great place, as there are so many indian restuarants, but as we are going out a lot at the moment, we decided to take a chance, and we're not disappointed, and to be fair, of all the reviews I have written, I have been mostly lucky, we entered the restaurant, which looked very nice, and was greeted by a friendly waiter, after been seated we ordered a lovely bottle of wine, and perused the menu i decided on lamb chops and my husband opted for butterfly king prawns, both were really sumptuous, and we were clearly anticipating the next course, of which we weren't disappointed, tandoori chicken shaslick which was my husbands choice, was hot tender and very juicy with tomatoes, peppers and onions, I had tandoori king prawns, so succulent, side dishes were sag aloo, chana masala and garlic naan, all were cooked to perfection, we also had poppadoms and dips which were the best ever, all in all a great meal, really enjoyed it"
219,"We found this place on TripAdvisor too. I could not agree more, this place is amazing. The service is excellent and the quality and choice of food is good too. We were served by a very kind gentlemen who helped us out a lot as tourists (my phone died and I only had a European plug). Please visit this place, it is worth it!"
220,"This was our first time visiting this restaurant and so we didn't know exactly what to expect. However we were absolutely blown away by the upbeat yet not overly noisy ambiance, the delicious and varied menu and finally, perhaps the most impressive aspect, the exceptionally friendly and attentive staff. The Sheba is a must visit for anyone who is visiting Brick Lane - you will not be disappointed."
221,Had a meal there today. Very friendly and helpful when wanting to choose mild flavoured food. Good service. Would definitely go there again.
222,"We had a beautiful time and an amazing dinner! The food was delicious and the staff very attentive! There aren't enough great things to say! The food was really top-class, good quality and really tasty."
223,"Lovely food and even lovelier staff. After spilling a drink and making a huge mess the staff were still so happy and made me feel less awkward about the situation. Could not recommend enough. The chicken madras, pilau rice and nan bread were amazing at a very good price!"
224,"Firstly the service and attention given to us the moment we sat down was amazing. our attentive waiter Abbas really did looked after us and foresaw our needs. It can be hard to please a group of 6 but these guys sorted us all out. From funny banter and not being pushy I couldnt rate them more. Oh, and the food was gooooood very happy chappies all round"
225,"As friends we go to Brick Lane for a curry once a year. This year we picked Sheba based on reviews. I am sad to say it did not live up to expectations. The place was clean,staff were friendly and we got a reasonable priced set menu at mid day. However,out of 7 meals ordered 4 were wrong when they arrived. 2 chicken Shashlik arrived as lamb Shaslick and two other meals were wrong. Some were changed but others were eaten as the whole purpose of meeting up is to be able to eat at the same time. At the end of the meal we all agreed that the food was poor and we would not return there."
226,I arrived at approximately 815pm. I was given a clean and comfortable table.Food arrived swiftly..... great! Speedy and polite service and very very tasty.
