1,"I had the absolute best dining experience at Da Andrea. The food was perfection: every dish we ordered was absolutely delicious. My favorite was the grilled octopus which was crispy yet melted in your mouth. I was also incredibly impressed by the quality of service. Our server Carlos was so attentive to our table. Our wine glasses were always filled, our dirty dishes were swept away immediately, and every employee was friendly and courteous. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the ambience of a warm fall evening in NYC. It was unforgettable and I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town. Don't miss this place!"
2,Nice place to eat at any time. Pasta lovers will love it. They have a lot of pasta on their menu. Service was great. Offered specials throughout the day.
3,"Had an evening reservation on Christmas night. Food was nothing to write home about. Service was average. Tool a while to get our main courses. Prices were a bit high for the size plates that we got, which were not exactly abbondante."
4,"I'm giving this one a five because we experienced great food and excellent service in a gorgeous setting. That's enough for me~ First, this review is based on a Sunday brunch experience. Second, we ate in the outside heated space, which one sees all over the city now. It was beautifully decorated and, although a very cold day, we were totally comfortable. I had the lobster benedict, which was two perfectly prepared eggs on a lobster ""cake"" and a really good hollandaise. Others had the polenta and eggs and two different pastas, which I tasted. The truffle pasta was amazing. We were immediately brought a basket of wonderful bread when we sat down and the service was attentive throughout. There were very few people sitting in the outdoor area and more arrived as time went by, but it never felt crowded. I don't know what it's like inside. The decor is gorgeous. I also loved that our waiter was really Italian and I could speak to him in Italian. Buonissimo!"
5,"Geared towards tourists. Food good but overall experience was very rushed. We arrived 5 mins before booking but were not allowed to wait inside despite very cold December evening. Tables very squashed and felt pressured to order and finish quickly. A ‘get ‘em in, get ‘em out’ mentality. When chose not to leave service charge head waiter came over and aggressively questioned us about our decision. Such a shame as meal pretty good."
6,"Great Italian while visiting New York. Both the pasta dishes my husband and I ate were fantastic and my son’s filet was great! The atmosphere just wonderful. Walking up the the flower covered sidewalk was magical. Such a beautiful touch. Our waiter was a little slow at times, but overall did fine. We would definitely go back again!"
7,"I was there with friends last Friday for dinner and the ambiance, food, and staffs were amazing. I had the tuna tartare for the apps, pappardelle, and chicken. Pappardelle was the best for me with extra extra cheese. Shoutout to Sarah for accommodating us, she is the bestest! Shoutout to Claudia as well, our server, and Carlos from the bar for giving us the best experience. I’d surely comeback!"
8,"Everything was perfect. I had the spaghetti alla carbonate that I truly recommend. River, his co-workers and manager were absolutely fantastic! I'll definitely come back. PS: I'm a cheese lover so I had extra extra extra cheese^^"
9,"When I see the reviews from people saying they had a spectacular meal here I have to wonder if we were in the same restaurant. I would not go so far as to say the food is horrible; I would, however, go so far as to say it was underwhelming. The best dish was the grilled vegetable appetizer, which had a lovely presentation and great depth of flavor. The grilled jumbo shrimp were average in flavor and lacked the grill flavor one is looking for (no grill marks could actually be detected). The saffron sauce for the shrimp was flavorless and did nothing to enhance the shrimp, since anything flavorless is incapable of enhancing what it is paired with. The puff pastry the shrimp were sitting atop was another flavorless addition to the plate - perhaps a smidge of polenta or risotto or truffled mashed potato would be a better base for the shrimp. The Caesar salad was decent but certainly nothing to brag about, and the cutlet specials two of my friends had were okay but lacked finesse in their presentation. Service was on the slow side but not horrible. As a frequent visitor to NYC I can't see dining here again since there are so many other options."
10,True authentic Italian food. Nice selection of pastas and appetizers. Friendly service and a beautifully decorated patio.
11,"I dined in at this restaurant for the first time last Thursday and I had an outstanding experience! From the moment I walked in until the minute I left I received great service. The wait time was very short to be seated, and the waiter continuously made sure I had everything I needed the entire time. My food was delicious, and the portion size was good. I will definitely be returning!"
12,"Since we were travelling all the way from Europe, I booked a table over the phone in advance for 11 people, including 3 children aged 7, 3 and 2. I was told that for such a large party I would be obligated to take a prefixed menu of three courses because there were so many of us, which I found reasonable and to which I ultimately agreed. However, I asked if it was possible for the children to eat à la carte because I didn’t want food to go to waste. They agreed and the manager told me on the phone the menu would be 45$ each. I found the price really ok so I booked the table without hesitation.  If only I had known, I would have asked to confirm this booking in writing!!!  The three courses on the menu came straight out of their regular menu. I, for instance, had the following:  Tagliolini neri alle vongole 26.00 Squid ink tagliolini, clams, cherry tomatoes, garlic white wine  Calamaretti alla griglia 19.00 Grilled squid, corn & cucumber salad, lemon dressing  Tiramisù 11.00  This makes up a total of 56$. Each of us had three courses, as agreed, which in total ranged in price from between 50-60$ on the regular menu. We also had three bottles of wine.  When we got our check, we almost fell off our chairs! They had counted 85$!!! for each fixed menu instead of the agreed 45$! The check was a total of 1168,90$!  When I confronted the manager, he claimed he had told me on the phone the menu would be 85$ per person. This is clearly NOT TRUE because I would never have agreed to such an expensive menu for a family of 11, for no special occasion, at a very basic Italian restaurant. (Mind you, for this price we could almost have eaten at a quality Michelin starred restaurant!) When I asked him whether I could see the price of the prefixed menu, he told me it was only based on his word and the price of the prefixed menu was not indicated anywhere.  This is not the way an honest establishment should treat its customers! By the way, should a fixed menu, based on the regular everyday dinner menu, not at least be close in price to the usual prices indicated? Where I come from, a fixed menu for such a large party, generally benefits the customer in some way because it is lower in price than the actual menu. But of course, I am talking about honest restaurateurs here and not embezzlers.  When I complained a little more vehemently he told me he was doing me a favour allowing us to let the children (may I remind you, 7, 3 and 2 years old!) eat à la carte. For the sake of consistency, a little sidenote: their spaghetti bolognese is 24$, and we ordered three!  All in all, a terrible experience in a deplorable establishment that obviously needs to rip off its customers to stay afloat. I understand why. Aside from the awful mismanagement of this place, the food is mediocre at best. Not to be trusted! For the love of God, do not set foot in this place!"
13,my friend and i went the day after st pattys day and the food was great and our server marco was so sweet and made the experience even better. we love u marco!!
14,"Bustling NY restaurant, some great/classic Italian dishes with good/very good service along the way. We were looking for a good; fun, Italian vibe during a recent trip to the city and this totally delivered."
15,"Choose this spur of the moment on trip adviser for afternoon lunch and had absolutely no regrets, lovely food in a quaint Italian setting. Highly recommend."
16,"Great food, well presented and lots of flavor. The restaurant is pretty and the staff is very friendly. A place to repeat in NYC."
17,You have to turn up exactly on time . It was very busy with a lot of compliant staff . Being European and having Italian heritage and many close Italian friends I must say for the money ($180 with wine and aperitifs!) I left feeling a little deflated. NOTHING felt authentic to me food was ok but probably nothing I could not do myself really. Lacking in Italian spirit really!! . Ok but doubt I would return on my next visit to New York.
18,"I was told this place had some of the best Italian food. Went for the spaghetti Carbonara to see how good it really is. For the life of me I don't understand the ratings: I did not get my spaghetti (al dente) but Linguini which was too al dente (I guess they used the spaghetti-al dente-time for the thicker linguini). It was drowning in thin sauce and the pancetta was a fatty bacon. I should have known when I was asked if I wanted cheese over my carbonara; any Italian cook's stomach turns when they read this (would you like some basil over your pesto sauce?). The only Italian person there was a very nice waiter, who's actions at the register were closely watched by one of the many south-asian looking gentlemen. Da Andrea?? Ma scerzo!"
19,Marco was the best waiter I ever had!!!! I had ravioli and it was fantastic per Marcos recommendation. I loved the ambiance and had such a fantastic time. This place is FIVE STARS in my mind!!! We loved the pumpkin dessert.
20,"Food, drinks and wait staff was amazing. We had appetizers entrees and shared dessert. In addition to afew drinks. I will return again."
21,Just had an incredible dinner with friends from North Carolina …the outdoor setting is so beautiful! Food was cooked exactly to everyone’s specifications . Can’t say enough about our wonderful server Nicholas… he was so knowledgeable and couldn’t have been more personable ! Thank you Nicholas and Da Andrea for a perfect evening!
22,"Our family of six enjoyed a delightful meal on a warm Saturday evening in October. We reserved an outside table, which was covered and shielded from the rain.  Everything we ordered was excellent. Highlights: fresh baked ""tigelle"" buns with Parma prosciutto and various pasta dishes. The prosciutto melted in our mouths. Our waiter recommended the Barolo, which was a nice red wine (light enough to be enjoyed by even those in our party who don't like a full-bodied red). The gelato and sorbet were outstanding.  Service was professional and attentive. We were asked for proof of Covid vaccine and photo ID upon entering (which was very reassuring for us). At 9 p.m. (when we had been there for about 2 hours), the host kind of hurried us along since he had a party waiting for our table. He was very gracious about it."
23,"For many years I have been a devoted and happy patron of Da Andrea. Even after the family that founded the restaurant sold it, I continued to dine there and even supported the restaurant during the worst of the Covid pandemic. But my experience there last night with a friend put me off the restaurant.  Although we had a reservation, we had to wait about 20 minutes before we were seated. As we were about to sit down, a busboy emptied a glass containing candle wax and water onto the sidewalk directly in front of my chair.  After a long delay we placed our order. The first course arrived after yet another delay. But then nearly a full hour passed before we received our main course, despite our inquiries of the waiter and manager., neither of whom returned. The couple at the next table over, who were seated a few minutes after we were, had long since finished their dinner and received their check before our main course came.)  I ordered one of the daily specials, which was described as risotto with monkfish. The plate that finally arrived contained rice and chunks of tomato. I searched carefully for monkfish and found a single pebble-sized piece. When I asked the waiter what happened to the fish, he took my plate away. I thought the kitchen would add some monkfish but when he returned the waiter reported the chef said “the monkfish was mixed in.” The risotto tasted vaguely of fish ( perhaps it was used in the broth) but it was bland and did not have a creamy texture.  Not only did the waiter and manager not suggest a peace offering for having ignored and misled us, as the prior owners would have done, but they didn’t even offer an apology.  The restaurant was not equipped for the crowd last night and clearly demonstrated that they don’t value loyal, long-time customers. Since Da Andrea had been one of my favorite restaurants, my experience last night was especially disappointing."
24,"We sat inside for dinner mid-week at the end of June 2021. Everything we ordered was delicious (grilled prawns, pork chop, carbonera pasta, chocolate cake, creme brulee, gelato). Service was outstanding."
25,It isn’t WOW or a destination restaurant. It is consistently good food and excellent service. Lots of pasta choices and a pretty good wine list. if you live in this area you won’t be disappointed
26,"Ordered filet mignon and it was awesome, the area and set up is very unique a great dining experience"
27,"What a great little restaurant. Tucked away in a residential neighborhood. Small, intimate, quiet. Service was excellent as was the food. A must try for anyone in area"
28,"The food is good, but don't expect the same prices that were pre-pandemic. They have raised them quite a bit and i guess that is to be expected. But the entrees are up at least $ 8-10 dollars each. But considering what the business has been through I'm glad it survived!"
29,Da Andrea is one of our neighborhood favorites; it is Italian and has entrees under $20 and has a very casual dress code (if at all) and you can make reservations for larger groups….it also has a great wine selection. This place is well known in the Village and moved to its current location because it outgrew its space on Hudson Street where it had been for many years.
30,We just past buy looks so neat and welcoming. Nice real flowers outside very European feeling . We order pasta papardeli - was amaizing aldante . Great place will come back . Love food made with love
31,"The service by Da Andrea was phenomenal. Me and a group of friend went out on a Friday night, we booked the table over the phone. I must say, from the store manager to waitier, food runner all was extremely polite and gentle. They took their time serving us as well checked on us for anything we needed. The food was delicious . I highly recommend for anyone that like Italian food to give Da Andrea a visit."
32,"Really good food. The bread was very good as were the 2 salads. We had main dishes of seafood in tomato broth with pasta, steak with vegetables and potatoes and a special of pasta with lobster in a mushroom sauce.  We had a desert of 3 sorbets and another of apple cake with ice cream. They also gave us almond cookies for free. Service was also very friendly. You sit outside. The restaurant is on a side street. Highly recommended!"
33,"We were in NY from out of town and staying at the Hyatt Union Square down the street. They highly recommended Da Andrea, so we gave it a try. WOW! Everything was so amazing from the bread on the table through to dessert. We shared the carpaccio and burrata salad to start, then the gorgonzola gnocchi and pasta with eggplant and spicy red sauce, and finished with the tiramisu and chocolate caramel cake. What a fabulous meal... every bite was authentic and a treat! To add to it, our server and assistant were both very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back when we are in the area!!!"
34,"We tried our luck with no reservations and sat at the bar for dinner. The bartender was super friendly and professional. The wait staff are moving fast and furious in this quaint restaurant. Food was delicious. We shared the burrata, polpetta, and salad. I had the risotto which was amazing with a red sauce, very unique. With a glass of wine the meal was quite reasonable. Will definitely return when staying at Walker Hotel again."
35,"We were on our way back to Brooklyn from the Meat Packing District and just were famished. Couldn't wait. I typed in Italian and Da Andrea was the closest one. We walked in and immediately felt like we had come home. Rustic and warm and inviting. It took us about 1 minute to decide on the Filetto Di Manzo: Grilled Filet Mignon, Spinach, Mashed Potato, & Truffle butter. we were surprised how quickly the food came out (15 minutes? so fast) and the filet was HOT all the way through (med rare of course). SO delicious and tender. Every part of that dish was just an adventure in savory and the truffle butter was the icing on the cake. A+++ for service, attention to detail, well crafted and presented dishes, and a warm and inviting atmosphere. We just found our new neighborhood Italian restaurant in Manhattan!"
36,"The place is small and was very busy when we got there. The food was very very good, but the place was so loud that it was very uncomfortable.  This is why I recommend you come her with your wife after a fight. The place is so loud that you can't have a conversation at your own table. So you get a great meal, took your wife to dinner AND you don't have to talk to her.  But in all seriousness, this place is louder than a Chinese train station during a mass evacuation. Food is awesome, but the atmosphere is so unpleasant that we cannot recommend you going here, at least not during peak hours. Maybe 5PM is ok"
37,We went to this amazing restaurant two days after Christmas the place was packed the food was awesome the service great the wine list great and reasonable food was authentic Italian and we enjoyed it immensely I recommend it for anyone who travels to New York to get away from the busy areas and down to a nice neighborhood in a beautiful setting
38,"Wow. I was impressed with this place. In a city of so many Italian restaurants. so many GOOD Italian restaurants, the competition is stiff, so it's really hard to choose one. I picked this one for its location as I was meeting a friend, plus I wanted it to be GOOD, and I was overjoyed to see how very good it was!  When we arrived, the place was packed, but I had made reservations, and we waited for less than 5 minutes to be seated in a nice corner table.  We shared the Carpaccio, which was incredible, I had the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara, probably the best I have ever had! Creamy, but not too rich. My dining partner had the Ravioli di Vitello, so delicious as well.  We had wine by the glass, but we should've ordered a bottle, as it was so good, but hey, that happens!  The staff was good without being overbearing, they leave you to enjoy your meal. I was surprised as it being so busy that it would be distracting, but it was not.  While it was a dinner with a friend, I would happily bring my wife here as it could be a very romantic restaurant!"
39,"We went for early dinner ... about 5:30. It was not crowded when we arrived, but filled up while we were there. We sat in a corner so I (age 75) could hear better. Good choice. We split a liter of house red; another good choice. Although I don't remember exactly what we ate, I remember thinking ""this is really good."" Would recommend to anyone."
40,My son and I were in New York and ate here on our second night. A great dinner. We started with a salad which was very good. I had the spaghetti bolognese and it was outstanding. My son had a risotto meal and he said it was very good. This restaurant has reasonable prices and the servings are very filling. If ever back in New York I will definitely return for dinner. Waiter was very good.
41,"I had the best spaghetti carbonara of my life last week at this wonderful neighbourhood restaurant. I shared a Belgian endive salad which was also very good. The restaurant is crowded (we ate on a Thursday evening) and it's noisy. I was relieved that we sat in the back room which was a bit quieter than the larger dining room. The service, by the way, was excellent. Because of the difficulty in hearing what my table companions had to say, I am my rating is very good, not excellent."
42,We were going to the movies and wanted a place to eat and there across the street was a gem of a restaurant. The Service was outstanding. The venue is charming. And the food was very good.
43,"We had a party of 10 (with a reservation) and were graciously and efficiently served a lovely dinner recently. Recommend the salad, the pastas and an array of desserts. Good food reasonably priced in a charming setting and very accommodating. Thank you."
44,"This small and crowded place seems to be a neighborhood favorite. Service is terrific and courteous, wine is drinkable...BUT the pasta we ordered came with a heavy-handed tomato sauce (we had the spaghetti Bolognese and over-cooked artichoke ravioli) and the mixed salad was no big deal. Prices are reasonable so you won’t invest too much if you need a bite after seeing a movie at the Quad across the street or hearing music at the New School a few doors away. My friend and I aren’t tempted to return."
45,"Excellent wait staff and very reasonable prices. Started off with calamari that was grilled to perfection. Next had squid ink pasta and clams, as well as cavatelli with salmon and shrimp. Huge amounts of seafood in dishes."
46,"Our family of four adults enjoyed our dinner at DaAndrea. First of all, the wait staff was excellent- courteous and responsive. Secondly, the choices for appetizers and entrees pleased everyone's tastes. The polenta with mushrooms was delicious. We all had to try it. I had pappardelle with sausage which was delicious, and a little bit spicy. My husband ate the zuppa de pesce. It had fish, scallops, mussels, shrimp. He enjoyed it. The other dishes were basil pasta and stuffed chicken breast. The place is busy. It was a Thursday night and we did have a reservation. I would recommend Da Andrea for a reliable, tasty, fresh ingredients dining."
47,"Atmosphere, nice. Service, OK - unless you're a woman sitting by yourself. As I was one evening in mid-June. The obligatory ""Some fresh-ground pepper?"" was asked and as I do not often do, I said, ""Yes."" The pepper never appeared. It appeared instantly for the couple sitting next to me almost as soon as they'd sat down. Anyway, the rest of the service was OK. I didn't ask about the pepper because by the time I'd finished, it was too late. The food was a solid MEH. I got chicken paillard, which had a tasteless red sauce and what I think was avocado sauce - two solitary strips across the back. It was among the more mediocre dishes I've had in my time and, trust me, with a part-time home in Tuscany and a lot of European/world travel, I've sampled lots. It's a pricey place, too. I will not be back."
48,"Great Italian- very busy even though it was a Monday. Great pasta, nice food full stop, very welcoming attentive staff who did not rush us. Carafes of wine which are excellent value. Highly recommended."
49,"My wife wanted to go to a specific place for dessert, so I told her we’d just find a random spot for dinner before hand. Thanks to the reviews on TripAdvisor, we decided to go here, and I couldn’t have been happier with the decision. I’ve been coming to nyc for many years, and as of now this is my favorite place for dinner. The staff was so inviting and kind, the food was absolutely incredible and the prices were extremely reasonable. Count me in for another visit."
50,Very inviting entrance with simple but very stylish setup. No bar only tables that offer wine and beer plus food if you are hungry. The staff are friendly and easy going. Food menu has a great selection of appetizers and main courses. We tried the mushroom and the calamari. Fantastic taste and good portion. We also got a mix of pasta for main course and must admit the food is great and very tasty. The rest is clean and well kept. Great small spot for few drinks and food.
51,"We came here two years ago on a stifling August evening. Two years later we stumbled on the same restaurant and two years later the food is just as great. The staff are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable."
52,This the fourth time here. The muscles were great as was the parpadella. Service is very gracious. A great neighborhood place in the village.
53,"I cannot say enough about this wonderful restaurant! All the menu choices are great; presentation is lovely, portions generous, service terrific. The dishes are authentic Italian from northern Italy. They now take reservations which is great. They make most of their pastas. Pietro, a chef/ owner is charming!"
54,"Dinner last night was delightful. Not only was the food great, but the staff were pleasant and efficient. The cost was reasonable. And we could have a conversation with our friends. We will definitely make this a regular place."
55,"Right across the street from the wonderful Walker Hotel, sits this absolutely excellent “neighborhood-style” Italian restaurant. The food was amazing...a very nice wine list...very courteous and outstanding wait staff!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy a great meal...in a quiet, off “the beaten path” type location! FIVE STARS!!"
56,"Da Andrea is a friendly and consistently excellent Italian restaurant with excellent pasta, antipasti, and seafood options. Always fresh and well prepared and the owner even gave my Mom a free panettone for the holidays on the way out. A total class act."
57,Birthday celebration was fantastic- you won’t find fresher homemade pasta anywhere. The sauces are unique. Do not miss the Bolognese. Service friendly and helpful- reasonable prices
58,"My spouse and I had dinner her at the recommendation of a cousin who is a long-term Chelsea resident. The food was fine - don't miss the tigelle modenesi con prosciutto (flat buns hot from the oven with ample Parma prosciutto) - almost a meal in itself. Service was attentive but not overbearing. Price was fine for a Chelsea restaurant. Not quiet, but noise was not a problem. I'd be delighted to eat here again."
59,"My wife and I have been going to this restaurant for over 18 years. The owners and waitstaff remember us and are friendly and accommodating. Since our daughter was very young, she has had severe food allergies, and the chef has always made her feel very comfortable. Recently, we arrived after 9 PM and were very hungry. We started and shared the salad special of select lettuce, roasted orange beets, marinated Portabello mushrooms and goat cheese. The main course specials were roasted organic salmon in a lemon sauce over lentils with roasted vegetables and duck breast with roasted cauliflower and home made pumpkin ravioli with a tasty brown sauce. The duck had a crispy skin and medium rare meat. We both specials with their house red wine. Dessert was 3 scoops of home made gelloti - rich chocolate and salted caramel. Everything was wonderfully prepared and value for your money! Can't rave about Da Andrea enough"
60,"The wonderful smell that hits you as soon as you walk into this small-ish, unpretentious restaurant is a clue as to the excellent food you will soon be eating.  Not a place for a business meal.  Also - they maintain their wines at room temperature, so you will want to have them chilled.  Mangia!"
61,"This restaurant is small, bustling and has a family-run vibe. It offers a variety of pastas and sauces. The salads and appetizers are sharable and tasty. Everything we ordered was excellent and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. We'll be back!"
62,The food is great. The atmosphere is understated. It’s easy to talk here which is always super important to me. I will go again and again.
63,The experience started at the door where the owner greeted us with a great smile - we lucked out arriving at 6:45 on a Saturday night 15 minutes before the crowd. Service was very professional and helpful and food was excellent and served with the sort of NYC speed that reminds you they need to turn the table over several times to pay the rent. Overall an enjoyable and meal.
64,The prices are very reasonable for all dishes. I tried the home made pappardelle with a red sauce and it was fantastic. Sat outside on a nice warm night. It’s on a quieter side street in Greenwich village and the subway stop is about 5 minutes away. I will definitely be back!
65,What a great restaurant this is. We went for an early supper on a Saturday night and enjoyed simple delicious fare! My veal and spinach ravioli was aromatic and really tasty. And my companions enjoyed their squid ink pasta and spaghetti bolognese. The wait staff were friendly and attentive at all times. We had a whole team looking after us. I wouldn't hesitate to go back there again!
66,"On my own, I started with the spinach and fennel salad. A lighter dressing might be better.  I ordered the mussel appetizer as my entree not sure it would be enough. It was more than enough and delicious, too. A large bowl of steaming hot mussels in a spicy tomato broth appeared. I managed to finish them off. The toasted focaccia was perfect for dipping in the broth. Wow!"
67,"This is an ‘old school’ Italian restaurant. Attentive, yet not obtrusive, wait staff. Delicious food. The specials were different the two days we ate there, and neither of us was disappointed. I am a pescatarian and the salmon I had was delicious, as was the risotto. The night before I had an excellent eggplant ravioli and my husband had pork. Nothing disappointed us. Highly recommend. We are on holiday from Australia, and next time we come back to NYC I’m sure we will try this restaurant again."
68,Lambrusco and Panna Cotta like Bologna! Kind service with quality food in a friendly and warm atmosphere. I look forward to my next meal!!!
69,Cutest little restaurant in the Village. Amazingly different fare and excellent service. After dinner we strolled the HiLine which was so close to restaurant to walk off our delicious dinner. Highly recommend this itinerary.
70,"We had 8:30 reservations for Da Andrea on Thursday night. At 6, we were starving, so we stopped in and asked if there was any chance we could eat now. They generously said of course and gave us a great table. The restaurant is just what you would imagine a NYC restaurant to be. It is small and intimate with fashionable people having a great time. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was warm. The food was wonderful and we all enjoyed our meals. Four of us ate for about $115 with tip. It is located on a cute street in a quiet and safe area."
71,"Met friends for dinner here. Food was good. Restaurant itself was fairly simple, nothing extravagant. Menu seemed limited that night; not a lot of choices. Service was adequate, nothing out standing. Pretty much an average establishment but prices were decent too"
72,"Excellent food. HaD Fettuccine Di Zafferano, the Chicken Paillard and the Cappellacci. The bread with the olive oil was delicious."
73,"The food, service and atmosphere was great. Neighborhood gem and definitely a contender for best pasta in NYC"
74,"Top service, nice atmosphere and can be recommended. Food is OK+, not a Michelin but for the price more then good."
75,We chose this restaurant due to the proximity to our hotel and were not disappointed.  The service was good and the food was reasonably priced and excellent. I had the ravioli and it was excellent.  Friendly waiters with great food - I understand why this has such a great rating!
76,"Meals at Da Andrea are tasty, moderately priced and a very good NYC value for your money. Something novel to try for an appetizer are the freshly made Tigelle buns (sort of an Italian English muffin) served with prosciutto and parma cheese. Great for a table of four, or two, if really hungry. Risotto is a specialty and consistently excellent. Staff is friendly, reliable for advice and provides unhurried service. Reservations are taken only for parties of four or more. Best time for seating without waiting (or reservation) is between opening at 5:00pm and 6:00pm."
77,"Met a local friend here for dinner on his recommendation. You can only make reservations if you have a party of 4 or more. Otherwise, be prepared to wait in line during typical eating times. The food and service were excellent. Pricing is mid-range (we spent around $200 with tip for 3). We had a bottle of wine and everyone had dessert. As many have mentioned, it is very cozy and not a lot of seating."
78,"My dad and I dined here when he was in the city visiting me. My coworkers had recommended this spot and we were not disappointed. The staff is very friendly, the restaurant is warm and cozy, and the food was excellent. It is also very reasonably priced!! This is a must if you’re looking for a delicious meal."
79,"Six of us showed up at 8PM on Friday night and were showed traditional Italian hospitality: ""Are all 6 here?"" ""Yes"" ""Let me check - you'll have a table in five minutes""  He was right, and we feasted. Those who had not been here before took the business card so they can find da Andrea again."
80,The food was delicious and the service was very fast & friendly. Also a nice place to sit and talk with family/friends.
81,"this restaurant is in the Upper Greenwich Village. We ate here on a Saturday night. It was about 8:30 and I had called and the gentleman said they had some tables but did not take any reservations. so we hurried over to the restaurant and got seated immediately. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the specials and the menu. I ended up having the House Specialty of the night their Risotto and my wife had their Hangar steak. Both dishes were delicious. It was crowded in there, but it wasn't too loud. I highly recommend this restaurant."
82,"I dined tonight at Da Andrea Restaurant in upper Greenwich Village and had superb food -- tasty with an imaginative presentation. While it was fully crowded, the noise level was fine -- unlike many New York restaurants, where yuppies are screaming or talking in loud voices. And, prices are reasonable. I wish it were closer to my apartment."
83,We had a nice evening outside. Got really good starters but the mains lacked a lot. Excellent service and good vines! Worth another try.
84,"Fantastic , my wife is half Italian so not easily pleased with sub standard food , but a revelation , great food , authentic ,brilliant service , I wish we had found this place earlier , a lovely atmosphere"
85,This is quite a good restaurant in the area. Food is quite good. They also take reservation. Staff is family. Their price is very reasonable.
86,"I have been going there since 2003. Has never been disappointed! The food , the staff are simply one of the best in NYC"
87,Never had such a good pasta then in this place! It has always daily specials there amazing tasting and the food is always fresh!
88,This is a special place in the city. From the warmest welcome at the door to the last goodbye you will not find a more pleasurable dining experience in the city. Food is outstanding across the board and the service is astonishingly efficient and convivial. All the salads and pastas were excellent but the ravioli special and lamb special were another cut above. The zabaglione was shared by my two young friends to great delight. Price is moderate and a bargain considering the quality.
89,"Beautiful, quaint restaurant on a lovely street. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Service was great. Food was amazing. Prices were totally reasonable. Will definitely return!"
90,"Moving our daughter out of her summer apartment while she was dancing in NYC. We searched for Italian food and we initially selected it based on the fact that it was a block from her apartment. What we got was a wonderful meal, very reasonably priced menu, excellent service and excellent atmosphere. Initially worried when we popped in when they asked if we had a reservation. But, they sat us almost immediately and it was the highlight of our very short stay. Will definitely will be back next time in NYC and just hope not too many people discover it."
91,"Feels like Italy - a warm welcome and the aromas from the kitchen draw you in. Last night we took friends who have to avoid various things, and they were accommodated with no difficulty. We have been here several times and always had an excellent meal. ."
92,"Very nice restaurant and very convenient walk from major NYC shopping, just a short step away from the busier parts of town into a more calm area. Food presentation was excellent as was the service."
93,Food you can't fault in a lovely atmosphere. We had an organic salad followed by Fresh pasta accompanied by a carafe of the house red. All equally as good and very reasonable. Would definitely recommend
94,"I get to eat in Da Andrea Ristorante a couple times annually. The staff is welcoming, and attentive when you need them. It's truly an ""adult"" restaurant where you can actually have a conversation. Plentiful wood notes help absorb sound. Tables have reasonable space between them.  On my last visit, I had a well-flavored hanger steak with shallot gravy, though I found the steak on the chewy side. Well, every restaurant can once in while put a less than stellar dish on the table. My previous meals at Da Andrea Ristorante have, without exception, been perfect.  Very important note: Da Andrea's prices are very moderate, especially in pricey Greenwich Village. The General Manager is a sweetheart: He really makes diners feel welcomed. Overall service is exemplary,...and well mannered!"
95,"Right across the street from the newly renovated Quad Cinema, Da Andrea is a perfect pre or post film destination. This is superb Italian cuisine in a warm setting- like home. The menu is creative with many traditional favorites and the wine list has some surprises for those who like to sample different Italian varietals. I had their ravioli special - lamb! Homemade and to die for! I will certainly be back. Nice outdoor seating too!"
96,"Unpretentious and warm place serving delicious” housemade pastas and other Emilia-Romagna dishes: The raviolis are delicious, as well as the gnocchis, polenta, etc. ( just stay away from the vegetable tower with goat cheese, quite underwhelming, and from the cappuccinos). The staff is extraordinarily friendly and gracious. And the deserts are heavenly. We shall be back!!!"
97,"Met friends for dinner - close to Union Square so this is quite convenient to get to by train as we were staying downtown. The seafood specials that my wife and our friends had were outstanding - our kids had the pasta and they enjoyed it. I had the chicken which was excellent - and the dessert was very good (bit too much!). Lovely ambiance - very cozy and warm, and not too noisy. The wait staff and the maitre de were welcoming and helpful - will definitely be back if we are in the area when we visit NYC next."
98,"This restaurant is on West 13th Street between 5th and 6th Avenue(s) and is accessible, reasonably priced and the food is delivered quite quickly if you are in a hurry. It is Italian and has a friendly atmosphere with the general feeling of it being well established, professional and good at no nonsense traditional Italian fare.  As it was just across the road from us, we ate there more than 5 times during a month long stay in New York and it became our 'local'. There is not much to add to what we have said save for the fact that it is licensed, has a reasonable wine list and is worth a look if you are in the area."
99,"I took my wife and daughter here while on vacation. The food was really good and we had a great night. Cost was reasonable but the waitress was very curt. The bill was $126 which I rounded up to $140 including tip. The waitress slapped the bill in front of me and said that the tip was not enough and pressed me for more money. I declined the invite. A real pity, as otherwise a very good place."
100,"We recently had dinner out at this out of the way small Italian restaurant that came highly recommended by a friend. It was fabulous! I had the Halibut entree and my wife had Salmon, both of which were very good. The server was knowledgeable about the wine, she was from the region of our wine choice. All was a great value and very good quality! A good recommend!"
101,"Zuppa di pesce is incredibly delicious. It makes you forget that there is a world around you for the moment. Ample supply of shrimps, mussels, scallops, and flounder in a perfectly seasoned tomato broth.  Braiciola di maiale (grilled pork chop) was so well prepared. The portion size was one big chop well balanced with corn and apple slices."
102,My wife and I were visiting NYC and went to this restaurant with a couple that eat there often. They take no reservations so you need to get there early. We arrived at 6:30 PM on a Friday and had no difficulty getting a table.  The service was very good with an appropriately attentive waitress. The general manager knowing our friends visited our table and seemed to genuinely want to make sure that we were enjoying the food.  The food was good but nothing that my wife and I thought was special. I had a pasta dish that was somewhat over cooked but tasty. My wife and friends all ordered the Bouillabaisse. It identified including shrimp of which their were two relatively moderate size shrimp. Two of the three people felt that it was bland. The waitress returned them to the kitchen and when the food returned it was more to the liking of the two who wanted it more spicy. My friends recommended the House red wine which was very decent for the money.
103,"Da Andrea Ristorante serves outstanding, delicious, creative, and beautifully-presented Italian food in a warm, inviting atmosphere. The location is also excellent -- a quiet mid-block setting on 13th Street in the heart of Greenwhich Village. Surprisingly, all of this comes with a very reasonable price tag, with entrees ranging from the mid-teens to the low-20s. Even if it weren't a great value, the food is superb, which makes the modest prices all the better."
104,"A small, bustling place with friendly service, drinkable wine for under $40 per bottle and solid, reasonably-priced pasta dishes."
105,"We were very pleased that the restaurant honored our reservation for 8 people and we were seated on time. This is a small, local restaurant, frequented by one of our friends many times, and we were all looking forward to a great meal. We were not disappointed. The service was very good and the food was excellent. Just as important was the fact that the prices were very reasonable for a NYC restaurant. With two carafes of the house red wine (It was very good) and two other glasses of wine, the cost was $60 per person with the gratuity included. We all had appetizers and entrees and a few of us had desserts. The pasta was freshly made, the fish was prepared as described, and one of us had the special risotto which my friend described as ""excellent. Reservations need to be made, but if you are looking for an excellent restaurant with an intimate feel enjoy Da Andrea."
106,"Really good place, we got caught in a snowstorm and didn't want to venture far from the hotel so booked at the last minute but it was great, really good food, friendly staff and very comfortable. We had a lovely evening."
107,"Really enjoyed their food reminded me of the food I miss when I visit my family in Italia. This is real Italian some the best in New York in very comfortable setting, I'm first generation Abruzzese."
108,"Tucked near the Union Square area on 13th street between 5th and 6th avenue is Da Andrea, a quaint Italian eatery serving delicious Italian food in a warm atmosphere and very attentive wait staff. Pop in here anytime but I love going here when the weather is cooler and I want some delicious home style Italian food."
109,"Came here with clients who have never been to New York. Food was very very good as was the service. Wines and food prices were very reasonable. All in all, we all enjoyed and look forward to coming back again."
110,"Delicious dinner on a cold winter night on 13th Street. This talented chef made homemade pastas---pappardelle with sausage ragu as was the veal ravioli in mushroom cream sauce-- were delightful. Salad of baby arugula,goat cheese, beets, avocado and endive in a homemade vinaigrette was a refreshing starter and raspberry sorbet a tasty end."
111,"This is the place at NY where you can eat Prosciutto crudo beer than what you can get in ITALY, com's with delicious small bread.Waiters are so nice.Ravioli with ham is very tasty.meat dishes are ok."
112,"Although was determined to have italian food while deciding to go there, was tempted by the day's special 'pork shank' which apparently was a big mistake. The meat was probably pre boiled and just poorly re-heated before serving by addition of a very poor tasting tomato sauce, sorry guys."
113,"Everything my wife and I ordered was delicious and served in an imaginative way. The pastas were particularly outstanding. The environment is comfortable, woodsy décor. The service was excellent and the quality worth the price, We are ready for a repeat visit."
114,"This place is such a tremendous find in a busy area of Manhattan. Prices are so reasonable, and service is absolutely charming. I loved my home made ravioli. I can't wait to go back and try everything else."
115,"Excellent food, excellent service. Wait staff was both friendly and knowledgeable. I had the salmon pesto risotto special, it was terrific. I will return again when visiting the city."
116,"Been coming to NYC for years and somehow missed this Italian restaurant, will be back there next year. The food was great every dish we had was lovely, well presented. We went three times during our stay the staff were very friendly and made this place feel like a high end restaurant. To top it all off it was probably cheaper than restaurants that were nowhere near as good."
117,"Food is spectacular in a very homey setting, a warm and inviting space with attentive service. Octopus and potato appetizer mouthwatering, but it was the gnocchi in Gorgonzola and arugula sauce that stole my heart. We literally spooned the lamb from the shanks onto our plates, it was that tender. Paired with Nero D'Avolo, perfection. We will be back soon, the most comforting restaurant meal I have had in a long time."
118,"Very good service , me and my companion decided we where sharing our main , presumed its portions where as big as others. They brought it pre split on two separate plates , nice touch. Only problem I could have eaten a full portion as it was so damn good !! Had the original tomato spaghetti with meat sauce , homemade and tasty. Desserts where apple pie and panna cotta , pie okay a bit heavy not much pie filling but panna was nice. Will visit again"
119,"Great quality of food overall. I have tried octopus and polenta with gorgonzola and portobello mushrooms and both were excellent. Chicken and veal as entree were fabulous too. I recommend veil. Drank a good bottle of Chianti. One of best Italian restaurant in new York if you are looking for a warm place with informal atmosphere. Giampietro, owner and chef, came out and explained his philosophy which is based on simple and personally selected ingredients and super quality controls on them. Must try."
120,"So….Some friends and I decide to get together for dinner a while back with these parameters: local, Italian, reasonably priced and good eats. One of our buddies suggests 1 of her fav local Italian joints, DA ANDREA located in the west village. Let me say this place is def a local joint; nothing fancy or outlandish but the service is competent and the food is solid! The price point on most of the dishes were quite reasonable!  A couple dishes that really stood out with me were the: - Animelle di Vitello (Veal sweetbreads, grilled polenta, braised leeks, lemon caper sauce) - Pappardelle (Pappardelle, sweet sausage ragout, truffle oil)  Definitely worth the visit! Good Italian food at a very likeable price!"
121,"Marco our waiter was great, the Manger took great care of our party of 8 from Ohio. Very attentive to all our needs and explaining the menu. The homemade pasta was al' dent I, was a great spur of the moment surprise 50 th birthday celebration for one of friends.  In an out of the way neighbor hood, a great find. Thanks again for the memories. Salute'!!!"
122,"We visited DaAndrea on a Saturday night , no wait at 630 pm. Our waiter was extremely friendly. We ordered the warm rolls with the prosciutto and Parmesan to start. YUM. Long story short....we all enjoyed our meals!!!! Pappardelle with sausage ragout mmmm!!!"
123,"I recently ate here for the third time. Previously service was excellent. This time not so. The waitress seemed to pass by our table many times before taking our order. Food was delicious, beautiful, and promptly came out of the kitchen. I would return."
124,"I absolutely love this place. You can sit outside or inside, and the food is inexpensive, delicious, and served fast. The pesto pasta with salmon and shrimp is my favorite, and the four cheese gnocchi is great. You can also get cheap wine and great dessert. Overall a fun, cute place to go with friends or family. Great atmosphere."
125,What a great spot! Had dinner here tonight with a friend who lives in NYC. Great food and service in the union square neighborhood.
126,Came with a party of five for dinner on a Friday night. Staff was warm and knowledgeable. Food was fresh and delicious. Great spot.
127,"First thing, the aromas grab you. Then the warm welcome, and you know you will have an enjoyable meal. All the food is good, as are the wines. Even if the room appears full, a table will be found within a few minutes. Go and enjoy!"
128,"This restaurant serves consistently flavorful Italian cuisine. The specials are very flavorful, creative in design, and artfully presented. I have eaten here a number of times. The wait staff is very pleasant and helpful. The ambience is comfortable. One does not feel rushed. Of their choices on the regular menu our friends and I enjoyed the Tower of vegetables, grilled octopus, beef carpaccio, and calamari. The artichoke ravioli are tasty, as is the pasta with veal in cream sauce. My partner enjoyed the chicken rolatini, and the grilled shrimp are delicious as well. In truth, all the dishes are well prepared- it is just a question of your personal preferences. Unless you have a large party, they do not take reservations. But if there is a wait, it is usually not long. Tables in the back can be quieter if there is not a large party back there. Otherwise, all locations are fine. There is a table for 4-6 in the front window which feels quite private. The wine list is very fair. Prices cannot be beat for Greenwich Village."
129,"I was undecided about a 3 or 4 star, but I couldn't justify based on tastiness of the food. Prices are great. Service is good. Ambiance very good. Freshness of food is also very good. But, there was no wow factor. We had the special salad of Gorgonzola, pear, radicchio, etc and it was good. My date had the black ink pasta with clams and it was tasteless. That's hard to do. I had the lamb shank. It was a terrific piece if meat cooked perfectly. But It had very little taste and flavor (and I don't like salt). The veggies were okay though the cannoli Beans were too mushed and the others tasted like frozen. I ordered s bottle of Sardinian red, which I've had at home, except this was by a different producer and much inferior. Would I go back? Not soon. The last time we were there was at least 5 years ago. Maybe in 5 more years?"
130,"The night before we had tried to get in but the line was too long...got a reservation for the next night...when I realized we'd be late I called...we arrived 20 minutes late and he still kept the table for us..great, great food..very reasonably priced..will go back every time we're in NYC"
131,"We attended Da Andra for a graduation dinner. The staff was extremely attentive and responsive to our needs. The food was very well prepared and delicious. Totally enjoyed the mussels, calamari appies as well as a very thick well seasoned swordfish steak. And extremely affordable especially for NYC. Very pleased with the dinner - will be back"
132,"Excellent service by knowledgeable wait staff. The food is good quality genuine Italian fare and the prices are very good. Well worth a visit. We had the gnocchi and the seafood risotto both of which were very good, complimented by a very reasonably priced house wine."
133,"This is a place for wonderful food! Homemade pastas with unique sauces- not the generic ones found in Italian restaurants around the world. The zuppa de pesce was magnificent; salads with fresh greens, not overdressed as is the norm. In short, a chef that knows how to create good food makes Da Andrea a delight. The restaurant itself is simple and comfortable with an excellent, professional wait staff. Prices are modest making this one of the great bargains of the NY dining scene. I've eaten at Italian restaurants in Manhattan at 2-3 times the price where I was satisfied with the food and value but the food here is better and more interesting!"
134,"We met with friends at Da Andrea The Service was Superb! The Appetizers we're just fabulous: Calamari Grilled with Vegetables & Antipasti- Yum! The Main Dishes were nicely served & very tasty! Lamb, fish, Zuppa Del Mar & red wine....everything was fantastic! The prices were fine! Make sure to make reservations ! Very Crowded & Happy Atmosphere!"
135,"On our son's recommendation, we all went to Da Andrea Ristorante last weekend. For NYC restaurants, the prices were extremely reasonable and we thought the food was great. I had the pappardelle with sweet sausage ragu and truffle oil. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now! My wife had the short ribs on risotto and classic spaghetti for our son. We really enjoyed all our food. They even had a house wine which some places there don't have and that was a nice touch. It's really a nice neighborhood with a great location. Service was good and we had our dishes in a reasonable time. All in all, a great experience. We will return on our next visit."
136,Always ask about the daily specials -- always delicious and made with the freshest ingredients. The pastas are always good and the fish & chicken entrees are beautifully prepared. For NYC prices are quite reasonable.
137,"The food and the service were exemplary. Our table was ready on arrival, I suggest reservations. The menu is varied with a number of homemade and healthy choices. The atmosphere is romantic and relaxed. I highly recommend this restaurant."
138,"Our group of five ate here twice during our one-week stay in New York - and that shows how much we liked it. The quality of the food and service is excellent, and at a very affordable price. I particularly recommend the veal and spinach ravioli, which is an amazing dish, and the chocolate walnut cake for dessert. They also have a large selection of really good red wines. The restaurant is quite busy, so if you're a group, it's a good idea to reserve a table. I wish I could eat here on a regular basis!"
139,This place has good Italian food. There are a lot of wine options but no cocktails or mock tails. The other option is beer! Food is overall nice..
140,"Da Andrea is not a very memorable restaurant. Apparently, my friends and I had all been there before (same group of people) and none of us remembered it by name. It was only when we all walked in and happened to be seated at the same table did we realize that we've already dined there.  To start, we ordered ordered a few appetizers:  Cozze in guazetto (steamed mussels in a lightly spiced tomato sauce, toasted garlic focaccia) - some of the mussels had sand in them. We also had some mussels in a white wine sauce, which had the same issue. Both of the sauces were just okay. But I did like that the mussels were meaty. A lot (if not most) of the experiences I've had with eating mussels at the restaurant, it usually involved really tiny, skinny, mussels that might as well have been counted as plankton instead.  Tigelle modenesi con prosciutto (fresh baked tigelle buns with Parma prosciutto) - if you order one appetizer, let it be this. The buns were perfectly warm and toasty. If you're a big bread lover, you'll love this. Even the non-bread lovers at the table said it was really good. Plus, the prosciutto was perfect and freshly sliced.  For my entree, I went with the Pappardelle (pappardelle, sweet sausage ragout, truffle oil). This wasn't the best pappardelle I've had but it was passable, though I probably wouldn't order it again.  For dessert, we had a birthday girl at the table so we got the tiramisu and panna cotta. The tiramisu wasn't anything special. Neither was the panna cotta, which tasted a bit too custardy - almost jello-like.  Da Andrea has daily specials that they update each day on their website after 5 pm. So if you want to take a peek at what you might order before you go in that night, the site is your best bet.  I don't think I liked Da Andrea enough to visit a third time. Though I guess the next time I do go will be when I forget about the last two times, walk in, and say, ""Oh crap. This place again."""
141,"This chef- owned northern Italian restaurant never disappoints. The service is wonderful (Paul, the manager, is especially helpful) and the food is always fresh. The home made pastas are great and the polenta with mushrooms is a favorite appetizer. Don't miss this one even if you live uptown."
142,"Pasta was done al dente, delicious food. The bread is ""to die for"". Good quality Italian rest. Chef even made special dish for a one of our party, even with strict no substitution policy."
143,"We had a great family dinner at Da Andrea. We arrived a bit early in the evening, but were welcomed warmly. The staff were incredibly attentive throughout our dinner, always checking on whether we were accommodated. The dinner itself was fantastic; rich, authentic flavors and beautifully presented, along with a few twists. My wife had the house special salad of beets, avocado and pepper coulis...it was a beautiful creation. I had the beef carpaccio and potato gnocchi in gorgonzola cream sauce based on reviews I read previously; it did not disappoint. It was a lovely dinner and well-worth a try."
144,"This is our favorite Village Italian Restaurant. They used to be on Hudson Street then moved to13th Street. Family owned, and lovingly cared for in every respect: The food is always the freshest possible. Home made pastas, are marvelous. Our son rhapsodies over the Gnocci and pasta. I am a fan of the salmon and the risotto, which they make differently every night. My husband loves the steak and pork, and the seafood specials. We've never gone wrong at the restaurant. The salads are excellent, the bread warm, the desserts, an excellent finish. The restaurant is pretty, charming, and comfortable, and the staff is lovely. We go there frequently, and when we have dinner parties we often will get the whole meal delivered from Da Andrea, which always has people marveling at the food. Make reservations on the weekend, as this is a popular place."
145,"The two of us were leaving the Whitney Museum on Saturday night and felt the urgent need for a bowl of pasta. You know the feeling. Good pasta in a cozy family style place when the cold wind blows outside. We are walkers so the fifteen minute journey from the Whitney seemed a reasonable distance. It was worth it as it proved to be close to what we had imagined AND as a bonus it wasn't noisy. There was a buzz of conversation around us in the crowded restaurant and even some piped in music but it won't interfere with your conversation. Northern Italian food with homemade pasta. Staff was reasonably friendly in spite of having to look after so many people. We had the Pappardelle Al Ragu di Salcicce and the Pasta Bolognese. Pasta was very well prepared and al dente. Sauce was very tasty as well. Couldn't decide whose was better. They were both very good. With a glass of house red, all seemed right with the world. Will be back."
146,"I found this restaurant through tripadvisor and it certainly lived up to our expectations. We had the delicious grilled calamari salad to start, beautifully cooked and full of flavour. I then had the house made gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. The gnocchi were like fluffy clouds in my mouth, the best that I have ever had. In my opinion, the portion was huge My friend had the risotto of the day which she also declared as delicious. We did not have to wait for a table (Thursday night)."
147,"Just had dinner with the family to celebrate my birthday. The staff is somewhat brusque, but accommodating and friendly, if not all business. The food is knockout...seriously, it's fabulous and priced incredibly for NYC. Pasta is homemade and superb. You will not be disappointed"
148,This family run Italian restaurant has wide array of Northern Italian dishes and a friendly bustling dining room filled with locals who wait on the street for tables every evening. Very good selection and great food and prices.
149,"I went to Da Andrea about 7:30 pm on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was busy but there were no other people waiting. There was an empty two-top in the front. When i said I was alone, I was told that there was a long wait. I asked who was waiting as there were no people waiting and pointed to the empty table. The maitre de just shrugged his shoulders and told me there was a long wait (do note that this place does not take reservations so in fact that table was open; he just wanted to wait for two people to walk in. This is clearly a place that does not want solo diners. It is 2015. Really we should do better. I would suggest that anyone eating alone go a few blocks north to 089 (21st between 5th and 6th); they are very accommodating."
150,Excellent food. Pasta made in house and top notch. Tagliolini Neri is my photo attached so good. A friend wanted a drink and there's No bar. Also no bar means no waiting area and you linger around aimlessly until seated.
151,"This was a very nice Italian restaurant. The food was very good and the service was friendly and attentive. Our group of three had a risotto and sausage dish that was excellent, a fettuccine dish and the rack of lamb which also were very good."
152,"Want to transport yourself to old Italy? The food, the ambiance, the staff… you're going to love everything about this place. Promise!"
153,"This restaurant was recommended by our bell boy. Just a few steps away from Jade Hotel. We ordered Squid ink tagliatelle with clams in white wine sauce, veal ravioli & tiramisu. The food was super yummy! Pastas were all hand made and using fresh ingredients. Waiters were also very very friendly. Love the food and the cost & warm ambience !"
154,"Restaurants like Da Andrea are getting harder and harder to find in Manhattan: good food, affordable prices, charming ambiance. It's a cozy, neighborhood restaurant, and I'd like it to stay that way. But with so many restaurants being priced out of business, I want to see them thrive!"
155,I never get tired of this restaurant. We go regularly and the food is tops! On my last visit they had a duck special that was so mouth watering it melted in my mouth. The grilled calamari appetizer is supreme. Go and enjoy as I do!
156,Great neighborhood atmosphere and reasonably priced. Had the grilled salmon and tasted both the pappadelle and veal ravioli. Ready to head back and order those as an entree next time.
157,"Everything was delicious and I liked the place (which was a little bit dark, though) The service was quite good, the guy actually sang “HB” with us! Te bolognese andh truffle pasta are awesome!"
158,"This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. If I'm in the mood for Italian in a warm, casual atmosphere, Da Andrea is my go-to place.  The food is excellent and the prices really are unbeatable. We love the prosciutto & flat bun appetizer (although we wish they offered a half portion!!), pappardelle, spaghetti w/ spicy tomato sauce, risotto specials, and of course the tiramisu. The house red wine is also excellent.  Da Andrea is a great date spot or even a place to get together with a small group. I always recommend it to out-of-town visitors.  They don't take reservations for small parties, but I've never had trouble getting a table. Just go and you will love it!!"
159,"We were looking for a nice little bistro/trattorria in Manhattan where we could sit outside and have a relaxing Italian meal. Da Andrea was good, but not great. We enjoyed the vegetable tower appetizer, but the rest of our entrees were just OK. We got there early and wanted to spend some time enjoying our wine and appetizer, but the waiter kept pushing us to order our entrees and finish our meal,even though the place was not full at all. In general, this is a good place to eat if you are in the neighborhood, but not worth a special trip."
160,"The food was outstanding,the prices very reasonable for what you are getting, the portions excellent and the service superb! This was the best Italian restaurant I've been too after Florence in Italy. I definitely recommend it."
161,"Have been twice to Da Andrea, appreciated the service and kindness of the personel. Interior setting is nice, outdoor less recommended in my sense. I liked the general quality of the food but somehow not particularly amazed the first time around, tried the pappardelle with sausage and truffle oil, couldn't really make out the link between the truffle and the tomato/sausage sauce. Second time tried the gnochhi and that was a lot better, i recommend. I think the drawback for me was the lack of any italian digestives/liquors... I really felt like having an amaretto, and when they replied they didn't have any liquors I felt frustrated... Anyway worth having dinner here, i'll be back to try other dishes (i'll bring a bottle of amaretto along!)."
162,"The best homemade pasta in a cute, homey environment. Can't go wrong with any choice here and the bread with olive oil they have at each table is addicting. Great place for authentic Italian."
163,"Something must be wrong , people put this as one of the 400 restaurants in NYC, this isn t even a real italian, food is so so as the service.not worth."
164,"Everything was tasty. The carpaccio was fresh and delish -- my pounded chicken paliard the oddest looking/tastiest dish I had in New York. So flat, so tasty and perfectly cooked. Was too full for the salty carmel gelato!"
165,"We decided to enjoy our last dinner in NYC at Da Andrea - the reviews were excellent and it was right across from The Jade Hotel where we were staying.  The reviews were correct - Da Andrea did not disappoint! We chose to sit on their small terrace on W. 13th Street and enjoyed people watching as we sipped our drinks and nibbled our calamari appetizer. We adore calamari, and it was among the best we've had! The service was relaxed, friendly and very prompt. Our wine glasses were kept full and our water was refilled regularly.  My husband had the black angus hangar steak with potato cake, shallots and cabernet wine sauce. He said it was the best steak he'd had in NYC. I chose the dish that local food critics had raved about: the homemade pappardelle with sweet sausage and truffle oil. Holy cow - it was beyond delicious. Definitely glad we came here - it was the most laid-back, tasty and affordable meal we had during this trip!  For dessert, we decided to spilt the tiramisu with espressos. It was so delicious. We will definitely make this our regular go-to Italian restaurant. We come to NYC at least once a year to bring our son to NYU. Our bill was about half the price of the other meals we had, and about five times as good! Ben fatto, Da Andrea. Ti vogliamo bene!!"
166,"After a frenetic holiday weekend we sought out this place far a change of pace. Blessed by a fantastic spring evening we sat out on the sidewalk, and for a moment felt like we were in a small Italian town. We started with a green salad and the octopus salad. Both were delightful and authentic, the octopus was warm and tender served on a bed of fresh greens. We enjoyed the gnocchi and ravioli special, each with generous portions and rich sauces. A nice half-liter carafe of red wine kept everything in balance. Plenty of pedestrian traffic and very few cars made the evening very enjoyable.  Two appetizers, two entrees and wine came to $84 + tip. A wonderful choice, thanks to all who provided the spot-on reviews!"
167,"The vibe is great. Very friendly and family orientated and the fresh pasta is delicious. Don't need to book if only 2 of you, just need to wait for an opening. Sidewalk eating too!"
168,"This is the second time we have been to Da Andrea. We had the tower of grilled vegetables, artichoke ravioli, mozzarella bocconici, octopus salad, seafood ravioli, hanger steak, bronzini, and pork chop.The food as always was excellent, except for an over cooked pork chop. We dined there on a Saturday night. Since the restaurant was packed and the tables are crammed together, the noise level was unacceptable. Also they served the food too fast wanting to turn over the table. So enjoy the food but never on a Saturday night!"
169,We went here with family and had one of the best meals I have had in New York and at very affordable prices. Very cozy restaurant with great staff. I can highly recommend it and I will definitely be back!
170,"One of our most espetacular dinner in Ny. Good Choice. The place is Pleasant, price is good and the service is great. The neighborhood is cosy and full of nice restaurants around"
171,"My mom and I dined here late on a Friday night. We really enjoyed the sundried tomato salad and the bread to start. The artichoke ravioli was good, but was lacking something....I think salt or seasonings. Waiter was VERY nice and accommodating. We would go back! Prices are reasonable too."
172,Dinner at this restaurant was wonderful. We were early before our showtime and wanted to take our time. They were more than fine with that as it wasn't too crowded. We ordered a bottle of syrah for $29 which is a bargain and it was delicious. We also ordered fettucine which have an olive pesto underneath and the chitarra. Both were amazing. Highly recommend this place.
173,"I have frequent this establishment for the last ten (10) years. I was having dinner, birthday's, Anniversary's celebrations at this resturante when they were located in a storefront operation on Hudson Street in NYC. They food is prepared and presentation is excellent. Service is performed as if you were a VIP and not just a patron of this resturante. The owner of Da Andrea is the Head Chef. I have to say in all these years I have never had a meal that I could have complained about. The pricing I feel is more than reasonable. Even thou they are not a white glove type of resturante, I would rate them there as one of that type of caliblier."
174,"For straight-forward classic authentic Italian cooking -- dinner of an excellent green salad, spaghetti bolognese, and a glass of house wine -- this place can't be beat. The staff are very welcoming and efficient. I could not have ben happier with my experience."
175,We came here for dinner with friends on our first night in NY. The food was amazing. Best Italian I have ever had. The mussels were juicy and the broth so flavoursome. The carpaccio melted in our mouths and the pasta was El dente. It had a nice homely atmosphere. Really great meal with generous servings.
176,We went with a large group of people on a Saturday night. It was busy busy but the service was excellent. The Food was amazing and the wine was good. Great buzzy atmosphere thoroughly recommend for a fun night out.
177,"I studied extensively for an Italian restaurant for our recent visit to NYC. This site and several others gave glowing reviews. I'm here to say these reviews are well deserved. The dining area is small and the seats are very close together. We were there this past Saturday night and the place was packed and stayed that way till about 10:00. Varied menu with nightly specials. Homemade pastas and bread were delicious. We had the mussels as an appetizer, large and tasty. Oh yeah, our main courses were A+. They only serve beer and wine alcohol wise."
178,We have been coming to Da Andrea for years. Northern Italian food is consistently good with a very friendly wait staff. There are specials all the time and priced similarly to the regular menu (many restaurants in NYC don't tell you the price of the specials and you go into shock when you get the bill - not Da Andrea) Wine's list has interesting choices that are well priced. They also have wines by the glass and carafe.
179,"Delicious northern Italian food! Check out the menu online. Had HOMEMADE VEAL & SPINACH RAVIOLI WITH CREAM, MUSHROOMS,PROSCIUTTO... so good. Nice atmosphere, small & cozy place. Good waitstaff."
180,"It is one extremely busy restaurant and with good reason. The warm intimate setting, efficient and friendly service, and beautifully made food makes you just want to eat and eat. Their specials are what we ordered based on friend's recommendations and it didn't disappoint - they make some of the best risotto around. Naturally, their pastas' are exceptional. They have an small but excellent Italian wine list and we tried a very good Sicilian Nero d'Avolo that paired extremely well with the risotto, pastas we had. Exceptional value considering the quality of good you get."
181,"Intimate place, friendly service and decent food. I intend to return to this restaurant. Prices are fair, which I consider important as well. The house wine was better than average."
182,Found this on Trip advisor and it looked good. Arrived without a reservation and we're lucky to get a table.Loved the food and very efficient service. Went back a second night with our sons and their spouses. Very busy place but service really good.
183,"Our family of 5 enjoyed a meal at Da Andrea on Friday night. I loved the pappardelle with sausage and truffle oil, and others enjoyed the Bolognese, the grilled calamari, artichoke ravioli, and penne with eggplant and mozzarella. The pasta is authentically al dente, and the ambience was very comfortable."
184,"My husband and our teenage son ate here last week for dinner on a week night. I had come across some reviews of the restaurant while researching for our recent trip to New York City and we actually were able to find it. Walked in with no reservations, great table by the window and the most delicious food!! Had the mussels, caprese salad, organic chicken and some kind of scallop dish. Nice wine selection, friendly wait staff and dare I say, reasonable prices for a nice dinner out in the City.  We are foodies from the New Orleans area and we are happy to totally recommend Da Andrea."
185,"That is what the host answered when we asked why for a party of 2, we could not get a table when only one guest had arrived.  I understand waiting for the whole party if it's 3 or more guests. But for 2 guests you will still have to give up that one table.  I could have said I was a party of one and be sited and still get the same exact table they would have given a party of 2. And yeah, I probably would have ordered a drink while waiting. Perhaps 2 drinks.  Anyway, all that is good, but seriously, if a guest asks you any question, don't answer ""because those are my rules"" you sound like the soup Nazi, and your food is not that great for you to afford that attitude."
186,"I adore Italian food, and the best Italian food I have ever eaten has been in NYC, so while visiting here I asked hubby to take me an Italian restaurant, and based on reviews, we selected Da Andrea.  Located in Greenwich Village, it was not close to where we were staying in the Chelsea area, but was a relatively short taxi cab ride away.  This is a small, quaint place, and while we didn't have reservations on a Monday evening, we were seated immediately. Service was quick and efficient. They had a nice wine list, and the food we had (Spaghetti Bolognese) was delicious. The pasta obviously handmade.  Loved this little place and hope to return sometime soon."
187,"My family of 5 was looking for a ""local"" restaurant in the village vicinity before we went to the Blue Man Group. Da Andrea far exceeded my expectations. The staff was superbly nice and our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu. He provided us with excellent suggestions and the kitchen prepared 2 of the dishes Gluten Free. We ordered the roasted vegetable appetizer and special of the day beet salad. For dinner we ordered the lamb shank, grilled organic chicken, salmon and the spicy eggplant penne pasta. Each bite was more delicious then the next. I have traveled all over the US, Europe and Italy. Da Andrea ranks in the top 3 Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at. Even better is the pricing, especially for NYC, it is extremely reasonable. I HIGHLY recommend Da Andrea. It's worth the trip."
188,We have eaten here on innumerable occasions and will continue to do so. The food and service r excellent. We had the roasted vegetable appetizer which was delicious. I had the lamb shank which besides being hot and fresh was soft as butter. U did not need a knife to get it off the bone. We shared a sorbet for dessert which was really wonderful. When in NYC this restaurant is a must. U will have to wait if u r only two people. They do not take reservations for two. The wait is worth it! Enjoy!
189,"This is a no-nonsense great Italian place in the village. Such good homemade pasta and swift, but not intrusive, service. A classy place. I'll definitely go back."
190,"A friend of ours recommended this place for a authentic Italian restaurant in New York to ""carb up"" prior to the New York Marathon.  It is a quaint place and well decorated. It is intimate enough for a romantic dinner but also a great place to get together with friends. The staff is very friendly. Our waitress was helpful and made great suggestions.  We started out with some homemade bread and olive oil. We could not stop eating it. My wife had a salad and I had soup to start. We devoured it. Delicious!  We both had pasta dishes. My wife had ravioli and I had spaghetti with meat sauce. The pasta is homemade each day and you could tell. The sauces were rich, delicious and made with the freshest of ingredients.  For dessert I had a homemade chocolate cake. Again, terrific.  The prices were extremely reasonable. If you want Italian in NYC this is a great place!!"
191,"Da Andrea is a great little neighborhood spot. The staff are friendly, eager to see you and to share their enthusiasm for what's on the menu. The fare is American Italian - home made pastas, the usual meat, chicken and fish dishes. Quality is high, prices are reasonable, and the wine list is pretty good. The next comment is not a negative, just a fact - there is no great imagination in the dishes, nothing that says ""wow, this is different"". And, they don't have a liquor license so you'll have to get your cocktails across the street at the Jade Hotel."
192,"Da Andrea is definitely a favorite of ours and I hesitate to review it as I don't want it to become too popular. But in all fairness to the restaurant and its excellent chefs and staff I feel compelled to write about it. You simply cannot go wrong in ordering at Da Andrea- from their appetizers like grilled calamari or octopus, or fresh salads -their entrees like boneless short ribs, or catch of the day or pasta, right through to dessert (best ever Tiramisu), your palate will be more than satisfied. Be sure to make reservations before you go."
193,Ducked in here before the Halloween parade and was pleasantly surprised by great authentic Italian fare in a warm and cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend if you are in the neighborhood.
194,"With so many choices in NYC, do not miss Da Andrea. Our friend who lives nearby eats here weekly and was kind enough to bring us here for dinner on our last night. It's a nice little restaurant, I probably wouldn't recognize it if I passed by again, but the food was amazing, and affordable.  Spaghetti Bolognese is my go to Italian dish, it's hard to find a good Bolognese, but Da Andrea does it really good. Others in our party had the leg of lamb which was huge and tender, and the potato gnocchi which was good too. As an appetizer we shared some Homemade Pappardelle with sweet sausage and truffle oil which was incredible. Just when we though we were happy with our meal, we each had a dessert.  The desserts are even more delicious than they look. The mixed berries with warm zabaion in a puff basket was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time, the sorbetti and gelato were also very good.  I will be sure to come here again, and recommend it to everyone."
195,"Best Calamari that I have ever eaten! The grilled calamari was wonderful. One person in our party thought the sauce was bland. My lamb shank could have had a bit more flavor. Don't get the house wine, buy a bottle."
196,"Opposite the Jade Hotel and close by part of the New School, this Italian eatery is brisk and busy offering very good quality food. The wine as always is a bit expensive, but overall its a good place to go. Really good atmosphere. If your stopping across at the Jade cross the road and enjoy."
197,"NYC Has so many great Italian Restaurants. So when I was introduced to this one I went with no expectations. In upper Greenwich Village the location is ideal for me to walk. I had the good fortune of going here with two regulars and the service was great! The food is served hot and is fresh cooked. I believe all the dishes we had were made from scratch which gave me a greater appreciation of the taste. Even though ""Little Italy,"" is not far from my home too. I would and will frequent this Great Rest. Have the meal of your life!"
198,"Fairly wide menu with daily specials. Tables packed closely together. I thought service was going to be rushed as the first course was brought very quickly but it turned out ok. Food good but not thing special. Portions were very large, I would have been happy with about half the size. One small criticism, a cold first course was served on a warm plate."
199,"We had dinner there with a group of friends a couple weeks ago. The flat bread with prosciutto was great! There were mixed reviews about the dishes ordered for the main entree. I ordered the penne pasta with eggplant which had a pretty good sauce. Overall, I think it was good and the atmosphere was cozy!"
200,Near the Jade-(fabulous boutique hotel by the way) so super convenient as we were tired from the flight and frenetic site seeing. Had read about da Andrea in New Zealand and we wanted an authentic Italian meal and experience. The service was quick and professional. Felt a little rushed and it was certainly very busy. We had the hangar steal with Cabernet reduction-excellent and reasonable- and a pesto and prawn pasta- Also very reasonable but a huge portion and just average. Nothing you couldn't do yourself. The bread was just divine and plentiful as well as the red wine- just a carafe of house but was just right and also a great price. Lovely atmosphere with loads of locals out on Tuesday night. Yes very noisy but everyone enjoyinghemselves. All in all a good first taste of NYC that felt authentic and non touristy.
201,"We came here for dinner, since it was near our hotel (we were tired) and served Italian food (ok with all) and it was very good. We split a beef carpaccio, which came with arugula, hearts of palm and parmesan cheese ($10.50). It was good, and a light starter, perfect for the summer. Bread, fresh foccacia, was served- yummy. Since the pasta is made daily (hard to pass up) my husband and stepdaughter ordered pasta dishes. I ordered a special with fish, sauteed spinach, clams and baby shrimp. Our waitress, who seemed to be Italian and was helpful, recommended it. It was $25, but very good. The fish was cooked perfectly, the clams plump and juicy and the sauce it came in very tasty. My husband got the squid ink taglionlini with fresh clams, cherry tomatoes and wine ($14.50) and he enjoyed it. My stepdaughter got gnocchi with gorgonzola and arugula ($13) which was delicious- light potato pasta nuggets served in a creamy sauce. It was a huge portion. For dessert, we got the apple tart with ice cream. It was good but the crust was a little undercooked. Overall, it was a great meal and we were lucky our hotel was right down the street. I thought the prices were reasonable for New York."
202,We had diner here with a friend we met in New York. It's a nice place to have diner if you want to avoid the business of other places in the neighborhood. You can even sit outside on a little terrace.They serve good food and have a friendly staff. Definitely a place we can recommend.
203,"We found the place trough trip advisor. For starter we had carpaccio witch was very tasteful and quite big, to share is enough. For entrees one of us had ravioli with veal and spinach and the other had straccetti with parma and wounderful cheese sause, we both were very pleased with the food. The sizes of the dishes were well enough. Luckily we had room for desert and we had the chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream which was wounderful. All together with 1/2 monti and 2 cappuchino it ended on $81 with tax included - well worth! We highly recommend this place!"
204,"Celebrated my wife's birthday while meeting our 2 daughters in the city. We made a reservation and although everyone had to be there before we were seated, we were seated at the time we reserved. Consistently good food and service. And finally a restaurant in NYC that is highly rated and won't cost you an arm and a leg. This was not the first, nor the last time will we dine here."
205,"Staying nearby, we went to this neighbourhood restaurant a number of times. It's always busy,and rightly so, as the the food is excellent, the service jolly, and the atmosphere bustling and fun. It was clear that locals used it as a meeting place, and we were always surrounded by tables of good friends having a great time. All the menus choices we had were great, but I'd mention the absolutely huge bowl of mussels, and the lamb shank which must have come from a very large lamb indeed - but was tender and beautifully cooked. Well worth a visit."
206,"Everything is great here! Great food, wine and staff! The veal ravioli is just delicious. I suggest the calamari as anti pasti."
207,"The “family feel” comments are close, but miss the mark as it IS family run as our Italian speaking daughter quickly found out in chatting with our waiter. We did have a reservation, courtesy of an in-law who used to live in the neighborhood and recommended it highly. We swiftly found out why. The closest experience we’ve had to our Rome travels. Even to having to ASK for the check (Italians don’t like to rush you) And when it finally arrived, how reasonable!!, especially for NYC. Homemade pasta (daily) can’t be beat. My daughter and I both had the Homemade Parpadelle with Sweet Sausage and Truffle Oil. Yum, the service was good, and prompt, while extending meaningful recommendations. Good value, wonderful food and staff. We’ll be back, no doubt about it."
208,"If you are looking for a small, intimate Italian restaurant with fabulous food, and great service, look no more. It is a couple of minutes walk from the subway stop, so is convenient also. We were there on a sunday night, and even though it was late, was mostly full, so reservations would be recommended. It felt like a family run restaurant, and the prices were very reasonable. We will be back..."
209,"Da Andrea is a small, cute and very warm restaurant with a ""mom-and-pop"" feel and excellent Italian food. The restaurant makes fresh pasta on premises daily and serves traditional dishes from the region of Emilia Romagna in Italy. The Steamed Mussels are an excellent appetizer and great for large parties. It is served in a huge bowl of lightly spiced tomato sauce with toasted garlic focaccia. My favorite starter is the baked-to-order flat buns served with imported prosciutto. It is meant to be eaten as almost a little prosciutto sandwich sprinkled inside with a little parmesan. The Pappardelle with sweet sausage and truffle oil is a crowd favorite.  In the four years that I have been coming here, the food has always been consistent and excellent. My only complaints are that the restaurant gets packed fast around dinnertime and they do not take reservations unless you are at least a party of four. Sometimes the service can a little subpar and some of the waiters are rude.  More here at stormypeach.com/da-andrea-nyc/"
210,"Went to this place after reading several menus and reviews on various website. One of the few affordable places in NYC that has atmosphere, excellent, homemade pasta, decent prices and appeals to teens and adults. Eight people went and we all licked the plates clean. Get the rolls with parmesan for the table! Good wine as well."
211,"We recently staying within walking distance to this chambering restaurant. We were tempted by the menu and the informal vibe of the place. Our first visit set us up to become repeat diners. Very reasonable prices, great wine list, even the house wine was really drinkable. Delicious breads and olives provided to get us ready for the main event. Food was delicious, the menu provided good variation, and time is taken by wait staff to ensure all patrons were well cared for. We aways left Da Andrea feeling very well sated. One evening I walked out and left my metro card on the seat and they ran out after me to hand it back. I was so impressed. Lovely place and people."
212,The food was very good and the prices reasonable for the quality. The restaurant did not have a formal feel however it was comfortable. I would certainly come back especially if I was staying within walking distance.
213,"I love this place.  We had, as a party of three, beer, wine, soda, olives, bread, a starter, three mains, two desserts and an espresso, and the bill without tip was under $100. In New York City. I love it.  Noodles are made daily on the premises, and it tastes like it too. My picky eater, who I was sure would resign himself to the old standby of Pasta Bolognese, instead went for the Paperdelle with Sweet Sausage and Truffle Oil. (!!) I asked for a bite, because it looked so good, and he cut me a square approximately 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch. My other dining partner, having had a bite of my artichoke ravioli, said he didn't want to share his own pasta, ravioli with veal and spinach in a cream, mushroom, prosciutto sauce.  This is as good or better than many restaurants in Italy.  Service was impeccable, but I will say that I found the reservation system perplexing. We were a party of three. Da Andrea's policy, as stated on-line, is to take reservations for parties of 4 or more. If you make a reservation for a party of four, and show up with three people, your reservation will ""not be honored."" This made me feel nervous about getting a a table, so I choose to go on a Monday night, and it wasn't crowded, we had no wait, and were seated directly.  I have to wonder if this restaurant gets very crowded on other nights? It's a nice little spot, very cozy and romantic in its own rustic way, and I don't know what you'd do if you were a party of two."
214,"left my debit card there and after frantic searching, right before closing, I contacted them and was able to retrieve it."
215,"Couldn't make a reservation because there were only two of us, so we got there at 7 P.M. and were seated in about 5 minutes. The menu was varied enough so that if you didn't want Italian food, you had a number of alternatives to choose from. The wine list was small but had a large selection of bottles under $35. Our food, wine and the service was very good. Restaurant had a large number of people waiting to get in and served some of them a hot beverage as they were waiting. Seems like a very good local place but you really need a reservation or to get there early."
216,"This small, cozy restaurant has everything going for it. Great waitstaff, seriously good & well-priced food, and great prices & variety on wine list."
217,"Da Andrea is not situated on a street in the West Village that you would necessarily visit and its exterior is not particularly inviting however inside the restaurant is cosy & comfortable and the service excellent. Having arrived late at our hotel across the road, Da Andrea only appealed because I spotted a number of people entering and caught a glimpse inside noting it was bustling. It deserves to be busy as the food was fabulous. Both my friend & I had the mussel starter and I can honestly say it was the best mussel's I've ever had - tasty tomato, chilli & garlic sauce and the mussel's themselves enormous served with beautiful homemade foccacia. Our pasta mains were also super tasty. The house carafe of red wine was very quaffable and the meal very reasonably priced. Can't recommend highly enough!"
218,"the food here was good. The service and most of the staff was ok. the manager/greeter not so gracious. we had an early reservation for 5 people and got to the restaurant 10 minutes early on a snowy cold day with one well behaved toddler. we were asked to come back even though the restaurant was empty and it seemed like we really should have been able to take a seat because all was set up well. we had good food - ho hum appetizers, decent wine, main courses, bland desserts and coffee all rushed along very very quickly taking away our food before it was all finished. the check came and we were asked to wrap it up because of awaiting diners. I might try this place again on a week night not on a early Saturday reservation. had we not been so rushed maybe everything would've tasted better but the intensity of being moved along made us feel cramped and definitely unwanted."
219,"The quality is good, the service mediocre, the sweatbread could be much better, not very tastful, the sauce a matter for discussion. Overall a disappointing encounter. Time to take care of the quality and the presentation if you want to survive."
220,"Friends brought us to their favorite place in the city to eat and we can see why! Starting with a vegetable tower appetizer that was so fresh and tasted like it was out of a garden in Italy!  My pasta, made fresh that day they say!, was wonderful, only compliant - not enough! The Veal Shank was so tender and fresh ravioli was outstanding. My wife's chicken - so tasty just a tad overcooked and not a god fit on the plate it was served on - that is why not a 5 tonight  We had spent the day walking the city so I saved up room for dessert and so glad I did. Loved the fresh fruit and zabaione. Looking forward to going back!"
221,"Every time either I have dinner with my family, friends or guests of mine, I have never had a bad meal. Also for what you pay for a meal at Da Andrea is more than reasonable. My guest or friends that have the pleasure of having a meal are totally impressed with the food, service, and the true warmth of the staff. Weekends anytime of the year prepare to wait for a table. Their reputation proceeds them. I have nothing bad to say about this great Italian restorante.  The owners and staff of this restorante treat you like family, VIP, etc. That is second to the great food of the day that is all prepared by a well respected chef. But you have to try it yourself to believe me as to what I have just wrote above."
222,"I'm a bit reluctant to write a review on this restaurant as I don't want it to explode with tourism but this is one great find. Clearly a local favorite and for good reason. The food was absolutely wonderful, the ambiance quite charming and the prices were just absolutely top shelf. The place has a major buzz about it. It was standing room only for the entire time we were there. Our best experience during our NYC trip. We will definitely be back."
223,"We visited this cozy, charming restaurant for an early dinner on a Saturday. Surprisingly, at 6 pm, it was beginning to fill up.....and we know why. You are greeted warmly by the staff and they make sure you are happy either your table, a nice touch. This is the third time we have dined there and it don't be the last ! I ordered the Pappardelle with sweet sausage and it was wonderful. My husband ordered the gnocchi which was awesome. Our appetizers were wonderful, the octopus and special salad. We always have the house wine from Montipulciano never disappoints. The price is right and food is worth every penny."
224,Great little restaurant on 13th street. My wife had sqid ink pasta with clams and white wine. I had the shrimp and salmon pasta with pesto. Both were absolutely incredible. What shocked us most is the entrees were both under $15! You cant beat that in NYC. I highly recommend Da Andrea if you are in the city...It cant be beat. Pasta is fresh made daily. Also great service and cozy atmosphere.
