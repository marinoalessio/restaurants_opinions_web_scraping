0,Great antipasti and super savory pizzas. Fast and very hospital service. Definitely a must visit for all true Italian pizza lovers.
1,"I have to admit that was one of my favorite moments in Paris this time. Ambient is cozy, inviting. Waiter was extremely nice and helpful. But pizza.. That’s just something else, simply amazing. From the dough until that last piece of pistachios simply brilliant! Pure magic! Would recommend even to my worst enemy!  Well done and keep up the good work"
2,I've never ever ever tasted pizza like that. I would take a flight just to enjoy that meal again. Incredible.
3,"One of the best pizzas we've ever had, served in a small, intimate restaurant. We got a table at the last minute, which was greatly appreciated."
4,"We loved it, the vibe the pizza, everything was perfect, staff was very nice and polite we loved everything"

6,Great pizza worth a visit original authentic good quality. Would definitely return again very good job
7,"Very small place, very good pizza, not the best I’ve ever had, but definitely top 10. Worth going to!"
8,"Fantastic restaurant! The homemade tiramisu is excellent, and the pizza is among the greatest I've ever had. The staff is in great spirits. 100% endorse!"
9,"Good pizza en antipasta. It was really busy andantes the main course and espresso we felt a bit rushed to leave so new guests could sit at our table. If you are looking for a place where you can also enjoy some digestieve or more than 1 coffee after diner, it is better to grab the food and move somewhere else to continue the evening"
10,"Excelent restaurant! One of the best pizzas I’ve ever tasted, homemade tiramisu is delicious. Staff has an awesome mood. 100% recommend!"
11,"Everything was amazing, the coziness of the place, the service, the quality of the food, the smell… I am sad I only booked for one time. It’s one of the best pizzas I’ve ever had."
12,"Very friendly, great service, the food is delicious. They’re able to speak English. Good vibe in the restaurant and road is lively."
13,Delicious pizza in an inviting atmosphere. Worth going out of your way for this gem. We especially enjoyed the signature pizza: Da Giuseppe.
14,"Fresh, tasty ingredients from starters to pizzas and delicious homemade tiramisu to finish. Intimate, friendly atmosphere with great staff. Also great wine. Thoroughly enjoyable evening!"
15,"Simple & effective. Great quality food, the pizza was to die for. I can’t imagine a better pizza in Paris and I’ve eaten plenty pizzas in Italy. The owner is a lovely guy who did his absolutely best to accommodate us. 5/5 for me."
16,"My wife and I had reservations and was unable to make it in time and they accommodated us with a later one. The food was absolutely amazing, although don’t expect a full Italian menu, it’s mostly pizza, still amazing though. You start out placing your order on a tablet as opposed to the server taking your order, which was a new experience for us. The waitress brought over our food and was extremely helpful when it came to suggestions. We started with the fresh mozzarella and tomato which was the creamiest fresh mozzarella that we’ve ever eaten. My wife and I both had margharita DOP pizza, hers with red onions and grilled peppers and I had the margharita with prosciutto on top. We also shared a calzone. The food was amazing. We highly recommend this restaurant if you’re looking for pizza in Paris."
17,1) amazing pizza 2) amazing atmosphere 3) highly recommended 4) next time we come back here we hope you’ll have a bigger restaurant because your clientele would be coming in more and more.
18,"Cosy atmosphere, friendly staff, natural ingredients/food, efficient ordering-process, excellent reservation handling"
19,Great food and atmosphere at Da Giuseppe. The owner was a nice host and even served me an empty plate to help finish my wifes pizza;)
20,I will never see myself eating another comfortable pizza at an easy pizza place at home. The bread was consistent and ingredients was f*cking perfect. Recommended here.
21,"Wonderful authentic fresh Italian food. Ease of service and a charming host. Very cosy space, with a chilled atmosphere and relaxed music. They deserve to be recognised as top restaurant on trip advisor in Paris! You do need to book as only six tables!"
22,Just a great experience. Good pizza and decent wine in a cozy environment. Well recommended for everyone.
23,Amazing food and service. Highly recommend. we had pizza and tiramisu for dessert and everything was fantastic. rating of number one restaurant in Paris is highly deserved.

25,Best pizza I’ve had. Needed to write 100 characters but the first four words covers it adequately. So hopefully this is enough characters now.

28,Very small but well run Italian restaurant. Pizza and appetizer were first-rate. Very efficient and wait staff really helpful and cordial. We will go back when in the area again.
29,"Da Giuseppe was one of the best restaurants we ate at in Paris. You could tell the ingredients in the food was very fresh. The Cheese was so good. I would order it all again. You definitely need reservations. We were there on a Thursday with reservations (party of 3) and every table was reserved. He turned away at least five additional parties who wanted walk-in seating, and two parties waited outside in the rain for 30 mins plus for take-away pizzas. The food & the service were superb. I highly recommend."
30,"We chose to come here because it was rated so well in Tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed. It's best to book, there are 4 or 5 tables and we arrived a bit late thanks to the Parisian traffic. You order via tablet, the owner is welcoming and very helpful and suddenly the pizza arrives. There are vegan and vegetarian options as well as the regular favourites. They taste great and they're very generous with the toppings. If you're looking for a good quick place to eat, this is highly deserving of its ranking."
31,loved it! The food was lovely and probably the best pizza I ever had! Also a very lovely and peaceful place to eat❤️
32,"Really great pizza! It's warm and cozy inside, and the hostess was exceptionally kind. We ordered the pepperoni and margherita, and thought they both were better than a lot of pizzas from Italy! Definitely worth visiting. We made reservations online, which was confirmed in an email the day of. However multiple people came in without reservations, as well as ordering take out."

45,"This hole in the wall place having won best Pizza in Paris award piqued our interest. The lady who took our order was very friendly and explained how it worked. We were over 30 minutes late, but she accommodated us. We ordered via an IPAD that was given to us and the order went to the kitchen directly. Pizza arrived in less than 10 minutes, and it was piping hot & very tasty. We felt it was one of the best if not the best pizza we have ever had. Ingredients were spot on, crust was perfect, and it was perfectly balanced in terms of cheese, sauce and taste. We look forward to our next time at Da Guiseppe.

58,"Da Giuseppe is truly an absolute winner! All dishes are prepared with a lot of love and dedication. You won't eat anywhere in Paris at such fair prices. The service is efficient and very friendly. Everyone should try this restaurant. Here you will be surprised. Try this ! (Message to Giuseppe : we are the ""photo couple"" of Thursday 14/07/2022 at 20h30. We will definitely come back often! Greetings )"

60,Great and friendly service but according to reviews I was expecting extraordinary pizza which is definitely not the case. Far away from the best pizza in the city. Tasty but nothing special. A bit expensive what it offers. I have to admit ingredients on pizza were refresh and really good quality. I didn’t like the bread… The best is definitely service.

92,"Amazing service and food. Tiny place, 15 covers but excellent throughout. Pizza was amazing. Can’t recommend enough!"
93,This is a very small restaurant with a simple menu .. but the food is very tasty. The owner works serving tables and it is important to him that his customers are happy . We ordered two pizzas one Margherita and one with some slightly spicy sausage both were amazing with flavour depth . He had to turn some customers away during our stay but he directed those individuals to some other restaurants! We tried not to stay too long so more people could try this delicious pizza .. would recommend
94,"Great size pizzas with lots of options for toppings available. Very modern ordering service with tablets available to send the order direct to the kitchen. Food arrived very quickly and the staff made an effort to interact with us in English as our French is quite poor.

Would definitely recommend, by far the best pizza I've ever tasted in my life with such an amazing taste and everything was so fresh!"
100,"Tasty pizza, but not the best i have ever had. Staff is friendly. Not a bad place for a quick lunch. I would certainly come back twice."
101,"We visited after seeing great reviews on Trip Advisor. The pizza was excellent. It was brought out quickly, tasted great, was very fresh and very hot. The only thing stopping a 5/5 review is the slightly odd arrangements. The toilet is in the narrow kitchen, for example. You have to say excuse moi to the chefs, as it is right opposite the worktop/cooker they prepare food on. There are also tablets to order food on, rather than telling the waitress what you would like to order, which makes it feel a bit impersonal. Overall we still had a great meal though! Oh and the tiramisu was excellent."
102,"We came to this restaurant to have a quick pizza and ended up eating really well, much above our expectations! Food was delicious: pizzas and starters (burrata and prosciutto and grilled veggies) were fantastic. Spritzes were good too! The place is small and cozy and the staff very friendly.  Definitively worth a visit!"
103,"My husband and I had a lovely dinner at Da Giuseppe, Paris. We ordered spianata piccante and carciofi et parma. The pizzas were hot and juicy when the waiter served them, but the pizzas had too much tomato sauce, although they were tasty. We took away tiramisu, and it was delicious. It's a small but busy restaurant so you should keep in mind to book a table before you go."
104,"Good food, quick, happy and polite service, we ordered one starter, one main meal and one dessert for two persons and all the time got extra so we could share. Small and cozy ambiance. Advise to make a reservation"
105,"Amazing customer service , the food was incredibly tasty, super yummy with a fantastic price. The staff members were super warm and welcoming. Definitely i will be back to eat the best pizza on my next visit to Paris ."
106,"Came across this restaurant by chance, recommend very good pizza place , good service, pizza delicious, Must order tiramisu ！！amazing 😋😋😋"
107,"First- make a reservation! It's very small but SO GOOD! We got burrata to start and we each ordered our own pizza, which is the way to go! I had the Regina Truffle and added rocket (arugula) and it was fantastic! My husband got one with whole anchovies and it was good too. We had a table of 6, lots of wine, tons of fun! Super friendly staff as well! Don't miss it!"
108,Travelling from England was recommend from friends. Amazing service and very good pizza. Very friendly would recommend 10/10. Good atmosphere good for family friends and couples

110,"I loved the service , the pizza was really good . I celebrated the birthday of my boyfriend and they gave us shots, and they sang happy birthday to him"
111,"This is the best pizza we ever ate. I recommend anyone coming to paris to try it. The crusty taste, ingredients, presentation, everything is 5/5."

113,It’s my favourite Italian Restaurant when I am in Paris!! Because of good reviews I wanted to taste the “PIZZA MAMMA MIA”. It was DELICIOUS with very high-quality ingredients. For desert I tried the “TRIS SICILIAN CANNOLI” and I would highly recommend them as well. The staff is professional and friendly. Definitely be back!!
114,I can honestly say this was the best pizza I have ever had. My boyfriend also had a calzone and thoroughly enjoyed it. We are only here for 3 nights and I am considering coming back for dinner. Amazing!
115,Very cozy little pizza place. They make the best pizza. Furthermore their staff is very sweet and smiling !!
116,Such a nice experience !! We were welcomed very friendly and recognized all the sweet details the owner has put into the place ! The pizza we chose - vegetarian and truffle - was one of the best pizzas I’ve ever had !! High quality products mixed with a love for pizza making - that’s for sure . If you’d like to have an original super delicious Italian pizza - this is the place to go !!!
117,"We were looking for a place to eat around our hotel and found this place. It’s a small restaurant with a couple of tables and it looked really cozy, so we decided to head in. A nice lady helped us; she was very friendly and helped us in english, since our french isn’t that good.  The pizza’s were really good and you could taste the freshness of them (you could even see in the kitchen how they were made). And the limoncello was also very nice. I would definitely go back if I had the time. Good price, service was great and the food even better. Definitely a recommendation!"
118,Because of good reviews I wanted to taste the parma pizza and went to the restaurant to do some take away. The staff is friendly and helpful and the pizza was delicious! Highly recommended this place if you want to have a quick but really good pizza!
119,I try pizza 🍕 speck - i really love ♥️ it - the taste is great 👍🏼 & service & quality is really good 😋😋😋
