1,I was in a London England hotel room with Indian takeaway and warm beer. @TheresaLalonde was sleeping as it was very late at night when Joe touched them all. I said “wow” very softly so as not to wake her. Still the greatest moment in Jays history.
2,"Delicious food, exciting vegetarian options, really friendly service. Would definitely come again if I lived closer. Maybe I will anyway…"
3,Empty due to it being lunchtime in January BUT the food was great. The manager was very affable and helpful. The onion bhaji was especially good.
4,"I’ve been eating here for 10 years and it remains my favourite curry in the world. Today may have been the best I’ve ever had here, consistently great, wonderful attentive and friendly staff, lovely atmosphere, I would go on but if I’m honest, I don’t want it to get any more popular as I’ll struggle to get a table."

8,"Incredible service, food, atmosphere. Very attentive, quick and delicious food, so many options. My freinds and I had a lovely time. Will be back very very soon!"
9,"Delicious food, warm atmosphere and welcoming staff. We were blown away by the goan curry. The most tender prawns in the world. The most tasty rice ever. And oh boy the Peshwarii naan was to die for. Every one had a large smile on their face - what more could you ask for? I know - peshwarri naan! 5/5 thank you Rinku for the great service."

31,"Came for dinner with my parents and absolutely loved it! The food was genuinley divine, could taste the individual spices in each curry, and even the fennel in the pilau rice! Delicate flavours mixed with soft textures (the garlic and corriander naan!). The staff were always on hand, and the food came in a very quick and timely manner! Great place to catch up with freinds and family or even for a romantic date night. Will definately be back, the food, service and decor were all a 10/10!

35,Amazing food and service. Can’t wait to bring my housemates here. very quick service. Food was hot and delicious.
36,Thank you so much for the awesome evening with my husband! Delicious food and nice restaurant with lots of options
37,"I can`t fault the quality of the food and service, they were excellent. However the portions were small and in my opinion very overpriced. The bottom line is you can get the same quality and larger portions up the road in Tooting where you are spoilt for choice!"
38,"Our first time long overdue visit to this restaurant was an absolute gem! We were blown away by the quality and taste of the starters and main courses! The onion bhajis and lamb samosas were exquisite, as was the lamb dhansak. Great attentive and personable service too, within very pleasant surroundings - thanks to Rinku and colleagues. We’ll be back here soon for an evening dinner."
39,"Visited Indian Room for the first time today for group lunch. Food was excellent and Rinku and staff were extremely friendly, welcoming and attentive. All 6 of us enjoyed all dishes and will be returning. Would definitely recommend."
40,"Fantastic meal and experience! Visiting London with my wife and we always try to have at least one Indian meal - very hard to choose. We were not disappointed. The food was delicious and fresh, and the service superb and friendly. Many options on the menu, and by night’s end the room was packed. Pricing was especially reasonable. Would highly recommend."
41,"Great food, can make vegetarian options! And good veggie selection in general! Good vibes, I would definitely recommend visiting here if you’re in SW London"
42,"The food was delicious, went on a Tuesday and got amazing service. The restaurant has the best vibe, cosy and fun. Brilliant Indian food"
43,"We booked a table on Fri evening for 7 people, we entered the restaurant and our table was ready. Staff were most pleasant and the food was outstanding… but what let the evening down was being placed on a 6 seated table. Four of us on one side of the table struggled to even look at the menu without knocking wine glasses over, we struggled to actually eat as there was little room to move your arms to tuck into the food. Sadly I found the evening pretty disappointing, I’m hoping that after reading this review, the restaurant will review their seating plan and consider the actual paying customer who expects to be able to eat a meal without struggling to eat. It really was that bad!!!"
44,After a hard day in the office. We went to our favourite Indian restaurant. Not only was the food sublime so was the service. The staff are friendly and knowledgable and made you feel at home. The food was cooked with passion and had great flavour. 10/10 would come again.

49,"Friendly service, really good curry and reasonably priced. Will definitely be coming back very soon."
50,"A small restaurant in Balham, very popular with local residence. Friendly and efficient service by the floor manager, Latif. We had several dishes, all which were flavoursome and colourful, some which were contemporary. The restaurant can become very busy and a little claustrophobic. The toilets require immolate refurbishment, hence the 4 stars."
51,I had paneer tikka starter and coconut lamb main. Both were excellent and the lamb was super tender with a flavoursome and aromatic sauce. Service was also brilliant as waiting staff (thanks Mr Shah) were very attentive and also chatty and friendly which I appreciated as I was a solo diner on this occasion. Prices were reasonable so good value for money too.
52,"This Indian restaurant is by far my favourite. It’s got a very cosy environment, very traditional. The food is amazing very tasty and the staff are extremely friendly. I ordered the wrong dish by mistake and they've changed it for me for free of charge. I will definitely be going back there. I wish I could give them 10 stars if I could. Thank you"
53,"Ordered the Rogan Josh and it was honestly the best curry I’ve ever had. Totally excelled themselves.  Fantastic service as always, really friendly and accommodating! Food was outstanding, and would come again and again.  I recommend Indian Room to all of my friends and family and hope to come back very soon!"
54,Been coming to this restaurant since I moved to Balham in 2019. Honestly I couldn’t recommend a place more. We get delivery and visit the restaurant. The takeaway discounts are very generous and the restaurant experience is exceptional. The staff are super friendly and attentive. The food is out of this world! Best Indian I’ve ever eaten at. They deserve their top ratings and awards.
55,"Absolutely outstanding food, service and ambiance! Such friendly waiters, they gave the best recommendations and served the most incredible delicacies! Would recommend this place to everyone and will certainly be coming back! 😊"
56,Called in for early bird meal but should have booked online. Although very busy they found us a table and allowed us the early discount. The meal and service was truly amazing and the curry one of the best I have ever had!
57,"Lovely food, friendly service, great price. Easy for a weekday evening. Open restaurant area and perfect lighting. What more to ask for?"
58,Lovely food and friendly service as always. Great local Indian restaurant for any occasion. Can’t recommend it enough!
59,"Probably the best Indian in London! It is amazing! Definitely the best restaurant in London overall when talking about the price benefit! Kind service, very lively and the best Indian you could dream of, very much worth it!"
60,"The food was unreal, service was fantastic, will be back 100%. Best curry I’ve had and can’t wait for the next time. Steve"
61,"From the first second we felt very welcomed here. The service was very fast and friendly as well (shoutout to Rinku). They have a big menu which offers many options, also for vegetarians. The lamb was delicate, big recommendation! Also the prices were very affordable. Will definitely come again next time!"
62,The service is very welcoming and the environment is relaxing and pleasant. The food is one of a kind. I recommend the non-vegetarian thali for a variety of indian food. We will definitely come again !
63,"Made a trip with a couple of friends during lunchtime, I ordered the chicken vindaloo with boiled rice and dhal as a side, my friends ordered the lamb rogan ghosh and the mixed grill.. all the food was exceptional, authentic Indian food which is hard to come by .. portion sizes were more than enough to share and the service was fast .. we booked online on opentable, and got the lunchtime offer which was 30 per cent off the total bill (only valid during certain times) .. my new favourite local Indian restaurant, can’t wait to visit again! Thank you"
64,"Happened to wonder past this incredible place. Was greeted by rinku, who gave me excellent service. They are so friendly. The food was amazing! I had a veggie korma and after spending the last 5 years in Australia it was so nice to have someone who knew what they were doing! I sat outside and watched the world go by! Please support this amazing restaurant, you won’t regret it. Perfect for date night, a friends birthday or on your own. Loved every second!"
65,Excellent restaurant with fantastic staff. Very impressive with the food at this delish authentic Indian restaurant. Not surprised to see them winning awards for their cooking. Staff were also very friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend.
66,Best Keema Naan Best Biryani SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH really good food excellent customer service best atmosphere.
67,"The servers were extremely friendly and hospitable and made us feel very welcome as Americans (they helped walked some of our party through the menu as well). The overall atmosphere was very chic and a bit more upscale; great for a date spot! The stars of the show were rogan josh and the achari paneer tikka. The rogan josh was literally DELECTABLE, a little smokey in terms of taste, and with the right amounts of flavor. The paneer was a nice starter to our meal, bursting with flavor and not too heavy to start out. I had a lot of Indian food in my extended time in London, and especially with how expensive it can get with meals in the city, this restaurant is the best value and the most flavorful restaurant in the area. 10/10"
68,"Back at the Indian Room again, it's just a fabulous curry house, the menu is really interesting and different and the food is just amazing - really authentic tasting!  Came as a party of three and had pappadums, starters, mains, sides, rice, a bottle of wine and two beers and it came to just over a hundred quid which seems excellent value for such great food!"
69,"Very nice food and good service. The staff was really helpful. The location was perfect, 20 min from London Central and a real hidden gem."
70,Best curry in London staff are friendly food is 10/10. Would recommend the mint tea and the zinger prawns.
71,"A little aside from the busy city of London (easy to reach via the Northern Line to Morden) we had an amazing experience with awesome, traditional Indian food, well made and incredibly tasteful! Also with various vegetarian and vegan options. For us the Indian Room will be definitely a place to revisit and even more to recommend!"
72,Thanks to the endless commited work of the staff and tasty food we always thoroughly enjoy our dinners here and it has become our 'go to'.
73,Food and staff were amazing. Our waitress Farah was great and very attentive. Food was delicious! Will deffo be back!
74,"3 of us went for dinner,and the food and service was exceptional! Onion bhaji, chicken tikka and karai chicken curry was the best we've had. Service was excellent in a busy environment! Definitely will be returning very soon.."
75,Amazing service and attentive staff. Loved the presentation and colours of the food especially! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a casual spot for delicious Indian food. Rish and Ollie
76,This is the second time we have returned to this restaurant. It was even better than the last time. The food is gorgeous and the staff are excellent. One of the best restaurants in London and well worth the visit.
77,"I came here with my boyfriend for a mid week meal and it was a lovely experience! The staff are so attentive and friendly and the food was delicious! We had a mixed starter and prawn puri and then chicken tikka masala, lamb rogan josh and keema naan. Couldn’t fault it, we’ll definitely be back!"
78,Had such a lovely meal here with friendly staff and a complimentary glass of wine for my gf….not that she needed it! Have the lamb chops….they’re the greatest in London!
79,"We have been meaning to try the Indian Room for a while and wow … our expectations were exceeded in every way! The ambience is great, staff are so friendly and the food is the best curry I’ve ever had. I can’t recommend this place highly enough. Can’t wait to come back. Thank you!"

92,Myself and my date had the best evening at Indian room. The service was fabulous and our waiter Sha was so attentive. I'll be back! With or without my date.
93,"Indian Room holds a special place in my heart. Moving from the states to the UK resulted in losing home cooked meals but every time I come here I feel like I'm part of the family. In fact the minute I sat down and ordered the Biryani the staff remembered that I loved pickled mango (Kerala roots!) and had it ready to dispense without even asking.  What's even more impressive is that the staff remember where I sat the last time and what I ordered. How about that for attention to detail?! Further The management and staff make it a point to make every visit a memorable one. It's rare outside of the Michelin Star world to receive such service. Whilst the service is phenomenal what's even better is the food. I typically order the Thali platter (alternate between veg and non) and you'll never be disappointed with either. Again highly recommend Indian Room and hope you take the effort to find it and enjoy it as much as I have. They truly make you feel like you're part of the family and ensure you leave satisfied and not hungry!  KR, Alex"
94,"Exceeded our expectations. Everything we ordered was Fabulous. Even down to the drinks ,great atmosphere,Attentive staff and a shot of gin The waitress was lovely who recommended some dishes"
95,Honestly the best Indian I've been to in a long time. We will continue to come and the staff is the most lovely ever Thanks again for a lovely dinner
96,"Amazing food, great service from Vengat, always a pleasure. Had the veg thali, amazing tapas style Indian food"
97,"Great food, great atmosphere, highly recommend the Thali. Great staff as well, always put a smile on our face post 5 a side #wengatt"
98,"We visited from the US and left the normal tourist areas to try this high rated restaurant, it was truly a wonderful experience. Our server, Shahed, made sure we had a extra special experience. Our first real time eating Indian food out, so glad we ventured out. Highly recommend!!"
99,Great location and convenient for weekday evening meals after work. The menu is populated with a good selection of authentic dishes and the hosts are very attentive. The food itself was tasty and I’d recommend it to friends and family. I will be returning to try more authentic dishes :)
100,"Fantastic food, fantastic service. Definitely worth a visit if you live in the Balham area. Great eating in or getting a takeaway."
101,"One of my favourite restaurants in London, amazing and authentic Indian food with exceptional service. Will definitely go again"
102,Super food with really helpful staff! Lovely atmosphere and ambience and when my father in law asked for some advice on his meal they sent a lovely lady who chose our dishes for us based on our taste preferences! It was all delicious!

108,"Food was very tasty and the staff was very friendly and helpful , and lovely atmosphere. We will come back again"
109,"My god! What an amazing meal. We didn’t book and were lucky to get a table on a sat night. Starters were really nicely presented and the mains as you would expect. Great service and brilliant flavours too. The spice was very nice and in that sort of medium/“lingers pleasantly” range which was most welcome.  Strongly recommend the lamb kebabs to start with, and the dhal was some of the best I’ve had."
110,"Food was brilliant and great atmosphere,Our waiter Venkat was friendly and very attentive! Will definitely come back again"
111,Amazing meal with my friends! Delicious food and great service . The food was full of Flavor and the thalli was outstanding
112,The food is incredible I love the ambience and service was lovely fully busy and lovely The platter was amazing
113,"Me and my boyfriend got recommended this place from my auntie who is a local. It didn’t disappoint. The food and service was incredible. Farah our waitress was so lovely and had a good giggle with us. Thanks for a lovely first visit, we will be back!!"
114,"The staff are nice. The food was okay, I don't even know if there was the discount applied to my food as we left in hurry. We saw a mouse in the kitchen area coming from the drinks fridge. We told staff and the guy who looked like a manger didn't seem to care. I'm writing the review in hopes they do something about it as I got the impression they already knew about it. And didn't care. It was also quite small making me think its one of a few babies.  The venue is also smaller and more darkly lit than the photos online so it was quite difficult to feel entirely comfortable  Unfortunate as it seemed quite popular but I couldn't ever go back now."
115,"Delicious food, especially the curries and excellent customer service. Definitely worth another visit :)"
116,Korma korma korma korma korma chameleon. Great feast. Good service. Sticking around for the extra courses. Loved the free shot

121,"This restaurant was recommended to me by friends, I liked everything, an excellent mix of flavors and new taste for me,"
122,Spent my birthday here - our second visit and we absolute love it! Excellent service and a great range of delicious dishes
123,"We were a large group celebrating family birthdays. The service was excellent, helpful with our booking, and first rate and non intrusive throughout the meal. The food itself was outstanding with a very varied menu."
124,"My wife and I went to visit my Daughter in London for the first time and chose this restaurant for a Friday night meal. The food was very tasty and reasonably priced and the ambiance was very nice. Our waitress Farah was very knowledgeable,professional and attentive."
125,"Wonderful food, great service and all round perfect! Highly recommend this restaurant. It is conveniently location near Balham Station and parking was easy as its free from 5.30pm on the side roads. This is my favourite Indian"
126,"Delicious food, friendly great service. Visited on my own after coming to Balham for a family party, I felt very comfortable eating alone. Nice buzz to the restaurant. A couple of Birthday Guests dining, we all sang happy Birthday while they served cake. I will definately return if I'm in the area again."
127,The best Indian restaurant I have ever visited. The staff are so lovely and helpful and very friendly. Amazing service. The food is delicious every time that we have been in. Lots of meat and Veg options. Very very good 10/10 would definitely recommend.
128,"You’d be hard stretched to find authentic, tasty Indian cuisine such as this in London and the naan was out of this world. The only place Indian food has ever tasted so good is in India. A must go."
129,"My partner and I ate here as a bit of a last minute thing as we were attending Banana Cabaret at The Bedford down the road. Managed to get a last minute booking on a Saturday, and we were not disappointed. One of the best Indian meals I've had outside India. Plae was busy and buzzing, lots of staff to tend to your very need. I had the non-veg Thali which was amazing and my partner had the fish curry, which was also excellent. Food came quickly, was hot and tasty and the prices were reasonable. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this experience and would definitely go back again next time we're in Balham."
130,"Had a lovely indian here last night and nothing could have been better. The food was perfect, staff very attentive and friendly and we felt nothing was too much trouble. They were happy for us to sit and chat after our meal and we didn't feel pressured to leave either which was nice. Setting was really lovely and overall had a great experience, would definitely be back."
131,"Food was tasty, the apple cider hit the spot too and the ambience is cosy. Service was good and attentive"

143,This was the 3rd time we have been and it gets better every time. The staff are brilliant and the food is exceptional- could not recommend more!
144,I have never had a bad meal here. The food is delicious and the service is prompt and friendly. Can't really pick a favourite as they are all great. Traditional curries and some house specialities.
145,This was outrageously good and we were very lucky to get a table without a booking. The starters were immaculately presented and the curry’s were well spiced but not over bearing.  The service was attentive and friendly and the only thing I can say here is that I’ve lived 50 yards from this restaurant for 2 years and I’m bloody annoyed I’ve taken this long to go!  5stars
146,I met two of my friends there at around 6pm and we stayed until around 9 We all had starters along with the usual bits that go with it and followed by Mains  The staff were always topping up our drinks and incredibly friendly. The food was absolutely great though. Faultless and sizeable portions. You'll definitely leave feeling full  Great place to eat
147,Went here with an old school friend after hearing about the great reputation of this place. Service and food quality was world class!
148,"Such an amazing service and food,My friend recommended me to book here… we have booked for 8.00 but we have waited in a queue for more then 15 minutes to be seated,No regret of waiting the food we had was really tasty will be definitely back again."

151,Excellent food for myself and my vegan companion. Great service and v friendly - this should be number 1 rather than number 6 in London

154,The food was great as was the service very very friendly. Thanks shams! Definitely recommend the coconut lamb!
155,"First time tonight. Good menú with some options o haven't come across before. Good presentation, really tasty and great service. And a nice free shot to finish with. Will def be back."
156,Had a most pleasurable dining experience here. The food was absolutely delicious. Perfect ambience for a date night and all the staff were amazing which just made our night all the better. Thank you so much and can't wait to go back!
157,I enjoyed my curry night with my family. Food and service was very good. I traveled from West London try this fabulous restaurant.
158,"Loved the food, the staff were so attentive and our waiter R. Ali was amazing! Thanks for such a great evening - a diamond in Balham, can’t wait to come back"
159,Fantastic Food. Even better service! I can't recommend them more. R.Ali is a legend! Thanks again. Conor
160,"Tasty food, good service. The peshwari naan was absolutely delicious! Go between a Sunday-Thursday and get 30% off too through Open House."
161,"We had the Lamb Karahi and the Rajasthani Ghost, with a side of Chicken Tikka, Rice and naan. Lovely throughout. Rinko provided brilliant service."
162,"Love it - delicious food and really friendly service! Would definitely recommend, will be back again soon!"
163,Amazing food Amazing service Highly recommend the vegetarian sides and the naan was unbelievable All home cooked
164,We came for dinner on Christmas Eve. The service and food were great. Our server shah was very attentive
165,"Sha was very helpful, the staff are always very attentive. If you're friendly you sometimes get a complimentary brandy at the end, which is a welcome surprise. Food is good quality."
166,We have been to Indian Room quite a lot since we first found it earlier this year. The service is always great and the food delicious. Thanks especially to Sha!
167,"The ambience of this restaurant is soothing and set the perfect tone for a relaxed and happy 65th birthday celebration with family. The food was delicious, authentic, diverse in flavours, and beautifully presented - this could easily be the best Indian restaurant we’ve eaten at in the UK - and we’ve eaten at a fair few, as well as being of Indian origin ourselves. The staff were incredibly warm, attentive, and went above and beyond to make the experience feel warm, joyful and familial. We will definitely be returning!"
168,"Visited for the first time, food and service was really good. Attentive, helpful staff and good variety of options for vegetarians"
169,Great experience at Indian Room! Shah was a great host and the foot was delicious. Highly recommended x
170,Had a great time with really delicious food. Excellent service by R.Ali. Thanks so much! We will be back
171,"Great food, amazing staff and lovely atmosphere! Go to discover the best Indian in balham free drinks and chocolates too!"
172,"The other reviews really do the place justice. We had a group of seven people for dinner, a mixture of meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans. Everything we ordered was absolutely phenomenal. Best of all, we drank lots of beer, several bottles of wine and mountains of dishes and it still only came to £35 a head including service!  All the staff were very friendly and accomodating. Definitely becoming one of my regulars now."
173,"Been here many times, hits the spot every time. It’s not too bougie, not cheap, not expensive - but if you want a traditional curry with pints of kingfisher in London (or in Europe), this is worth a visit."
174,"Amazing food, great service! 10/10. Everything we ordered was awesome. Great recommendations from the staff"
175,Food is amazing. Service is even better and all the waiters are super friendly. Such a great curry house. Thank you and we’ll definitely be back again.
176,I was walking past with a friend and we hadn’t decided where to go but we were drawn in by the low lighting and nice smells. I couldn’t recommend the best service and food and we’ll definitely be back.
177,Very friendly staff nice evening with friends…amazing food with cosy atmosphere came here by their reviews .absolutely Fantastic will definitely coming back
178,Honestly a cosy restaurant found in Heart of london The service is awesome food is absolutely amazing We had couple of starters which were outstanding will definitely recommend this place
179,Delicious! We tried the non vegetarian thali and the spinach paneer and everything was very good. Great to share between two people. Would recommend!
180,"And I've probably had over a thousand curries. This is a real surprise, from the outside looks like a standard town centre curry house, and on the inside looks the same. The menu is where it starts to look different - all the ususal favourites but a lot of different dishes I hadn't seen before, and all well priced. The food when it came was amazing, easily the best curry I have had and priced around the mid-range of what I've paid. Absolutely superb - just come!"
181,"Poor service and mediocre food. This place must have fake reviews or people in London have poor taste. First they sat us within inches of other tables. There were no COVID restrictions enforced whatsoever. They have it packed to the brim with no concern for public safety. If someone there has COVID, you will too.  Next they only gave us one menu, and acted like it was our fault that they did that by the time we finally got them to give another one to us. Then they took their time taking our drink order and started to give us someone else's drink order when they finally came to take it. Either, they couldn't hear us because the place was too crowded or they can't understand English well. I'm not sure what the issue was.  After all that, the food was surprisingly bland. We ordered dishes we have had previously at other restaurants, and these were like the lesser versions of those. To add insult to injury, rice isn't included with your entree like other Indian restaurants. The chicken was not great quality either. Honestly, you're so much better off at many of the lower rated Indian restaurants. This place is overrated, fake, overpriced, and mediocre."
182,"Beautiful food, lovely atmosphere and great service. Our favourite Indian restaurant, and will be back again very soon!"
183,"Lovely restaurant, our fave Indian restaurant in London! Staff are lovely, the inside is very nicely decorated with lots of fairy lights and good mood lighting! Food was delicious and great value! Will be coming back"
184,Lovely food and great service. Very good value 🤑 great for a bite to eat. Would definitely recommend 👍🏻 thanks for a nice evening
185,"Visited for lunch on a Saturday. Food was very tasty, excelle bt value. Staff were very friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Will definitely be back"
186,"We went to the Indian Room for dinner on Friday evening and it was one of the best experiences we’ve had in London. Every table in the restaurant was full but it still had a homely atmosphere and it smelled amazing. The food came promptly and tasted incredible, couldn’t fault it at all! Finished off with a baileys, it was overall a fantastic evening and couldn’t recommend it enough."
187,"An excellent Sunday meal. Not from these parts so went blind. Being a Sunday lunchtime it was quite quiet, but that was perfect for idling away a couple of hours over our food. They boast a healthy approach to cooking on the website(no ghee etc) and that was noticeable (in a good way). Will be back next time we're in Balham."
188,"I came here on the recommendation of a friend and it hugely delivered. Lovely low-lit atmosphere made for a very cosy evening. Service was brilliant, everyone was very friendly and helpful. Food was great also, I would definitely recommend coming here!"
189,"Lovely atmosphere, great food and great value. It’s nice to go for a meal that feels a bit classier!"
190,"Friendly staff, nice vegetarian and vegan options, very delicious spices and fresh food (the okra side dish is amazing). I hope to have more good indian restaurants in Amsterdam!"
191,"We had a dinner here few days ago. I can highly recommend the curry, that was absolutely outstanding. Nice, and friendly staff is also a forte point of the Indian room. We will definitely be back!"
192,"Had a great curry in Indian rooms, would recommend. Fantastic service from farah in particular. Will come again"
193,"Great food and service, farah provided great service and generally a great meal. Would definitely recommend."
194,"Wow! I cannot fault it. If you are ever near the Balham area of London, I would definitely recommend that you check this place out."
195,"Lovely food, best Indian we’ve have in London. Came for a birthday party with a group of friends. Can’t wait to go again.."
196,"Amazing service for a 25th birthday! Best Indian in south London, friendly staff and delicious food!"
197,Never disappoints. Delicious food (highly recommend the Chicken Lavabdar) and really lovely service. Lucky to have this as a local!
198,The food is authentic (of course) and really very good. Not too much. Just enough though and very affordable. But the tables are small and there are too many to my liking. You are packed like sardines in this place like in an average French bistro. People are way too close to each other which makes it difficult -if not impossible- to have a normal conversation. Very noisy and a bit uncomfortable.
199,"We dined here, the service was good. All the food could of been a lot hotter and portions we small. However the thing that really ruined our night was the fact we were packed in that place like sardines! practically sat on the table next to us knees, not enjoyable."
200,"Wow! Another amazing experience at the Indian Room in Balham. This is truly a gem of a place. Myself and my partner have dined in many places and the Indian room is definitely one of our faves. Food, service and atmosphere, top marks all round. I cannot fault it. If you are ever near the Balham area of London, I would definitely recommend that you check this place out. Thank you to Rinku and the team for another brilliant meal!"
201,A lot of times available Indian Restaurant. You can change your menu even your eating time. Had a Great lunch.
202,"Fantastic service, and even better food. Would highly recommend for either weekday or weekend night. Close to public transport too"
203,"A fantastic experience, as soon as we walked in we felt as if we were welcomed into a family home. The service is one of a kind and the food is excellent. Whether it be a fruity Friday night or a tactical Tuesday meal India Room provides. Thankfully I only live 2 minutes away!"
204,I love this place so much. I live in the area and it’s my go to!! Honestly the best Indian I have ever had - I am veggie and they have so many options and are so accommodating. Plus the service is amazing!!
205,Delicious food - had the paneer makhani. Lovely service and will definitely be back. Reasonably priced.
206,"Excellent service and food! I particularly liked all the vegetarian dishes, which were all lovely. Top quality restaurant that keeps me coming back and brining friends over so they learn about Indian Room."
207,Excellent food and service. We will definitely be coming back again. Top quality restaurant in Balham.
208,"The food was delicious, we particularly enjoyed the peshwari nan. This is our third time here and the food is always amazing. Our waiter Ali was so friendly and the service overall was excellent and efficient. We'll definitely be back."
209,Great food. Lovely staff. Served by R Ali. Would defiantly recommend. Had a chicken jalfrezi was lovely. Very fast service.
210,"Had a fabulous dinner here tonight, friendly staff, quick service and the most amazing food you could imagine. Nothing disappoints here!! R Ali gave impeccable service tonight. Thanks guys, we will be back! Ck"
211,"R-Ali was amazing! Great food, ambience and setting. I don’t know how they do it but the bottled king fishers taste better than they do elsewhere. Rumour has it that they have a direct cross-continental pipeline from the brewery but who believes rumours? Me, I believe the rumours"
212,"We were taken there by family that had been before but it was our first visit. I do love an Indian meal, and have to say this place didn’t disappoint at all. The staff there are very friendly and set a relaxed tone which is great. The food was outstanding - I had the chicken chettinad which was spicy and tasty as were the breads. The four of us chose different dishes and they were all good. They had a reasonable range of South Indian as well as North Indian dishes. The prices seemed reasonable and there was no attempt to hurry us out. I would love to go back."
213,This place is without question the best indian i've had in London if your passing pop in bye and try any of the starters.
214,"Honestly cannot recommend this place enough, the service was amazing and the staff were very attentive. The food was really tasty and portion sizes were very generous. I would have no qualms recommending this place to anyone."
215,"The staff were incredibly welcoming and it was a lovely environment. The food was amazing. We had the vegetarian starter which was beautifully presented and tasted incredible. All homemade and tasted so fresh. The curries, rice and naans were all so delicious, one of the best curries I have had. The staff went out of their way to ensure we had a good meal, keeping our drinks topped up and ensuring we were happy throughout. At the end of the meal they gave us a complimentary drink while we were paying the bill. I don’t often leave reviews but this place was exceptional and they definitely deserve the positive feedback. We will definitely be back."
216,"We've been searching for an Indian restaurant in London on Tripadvisor, and found the ""Indian Room"". So lucky, we booked a reservation! Looking at the map, we noticed, that it is a bit down in the south, but really close to the underground station Balham, so no problem to get there.  We were too early, but could be seated anyways. (Staff's really accommodating. May be a bit chatty, but that was alright.) For starters we chose Papadam bread, Kachumber Onion Salad, and the Non-Vegetarian Platter, all of which we really enjoyed. In particular, the Dips, that came with the Papadam have been very nice.  For the main, I had the Chicken Tikka Makhani, which was lovely. (Don't remember, what the others had.) And, as promised: It wasn't hot.  To drink, we had a 660 ml Kingfisher Beer, that I heartily recommend.  All in all, we enjoyed the evening very much. (Including the Whiskey, that was offered on the house. So good, if you have the Underground for getting home! ;-)"
217,"The staff were incredibly friendly and professional. The dark mint sauce that came with the poppadoms, the vegetarian plater, and the paneer saag channa main were delicious. The paneer makhani curry was incredibly sweet and I had to send it back. They made a complimentary one which was spicy but still sweet. I think the menu or staff should say this is meant to taste sweet. They also gave me a complimentary naan which was nice of them. The naans are over priced at £3.50 each. I'd go again though."
218,"Having read the reviews, we had high hopes for this place, unfortunately however our takeaway was pretty disappointing. I've had a number of chicken kormas in my life and this one just wasn't great - the sauce was rather bitty and it had an overpowering flavour of cardamom. The rest of the food was also just pretty average. A real shame!"
219,"Best Indian restaurant in London! Great food, superb service and a wonderful atmosphere. We have visited both over the weekend and during the week and the atmosphere is always great. Prices are very good and portion sizes more than big enough. Would recommend to anyone who loves good Indian food."
220,A nice but pretty standard Indian restaurant similar to that found in most places . Food is ok but nothing different to the norm. Service is ok. Prices are ok. Nothing really to right home about . Pretty empty.
221,"In think this may be the Best Indian Restaurant on planet earth! I traveled to India in 2018 and during my visit I decided to eat at what is supposed to be the best Indian food on the Planet. I could not deny that claim until now! The Indian Room is far better, I honestly do strongly feel this is the best Indian on planet earth! If there are also Indian Restaurants on other planets in other solar systems, then I believe the Indian Room is the best in the Galaxy!"
222,Amazing meal with the girls! Delicious food and amazing service! 10/10 would recommend!!! The food was full of flavour and the decor is beautiful.
223,"Had the nicest visit to the Indian room, not always in that you get delicious food and amazing services the same time! We will definitely be back!"
224,"Amazing service and great food! Couldn't recommend enough, will be back soon! Must visit if you are in Balham! Get the spring chicken lavabdar"
225,If you want your taste buds to be TANTALISED this is the place!! Love it here so much. The service is brilliant and the food wonderful. We will be back!!
226,"Amazing dining experience in the heart of Balham. Indian Room has survived the influx of swanky bars and cafes through its authentic, warm and friendly service. The incredible food is served kindly by friendly faces who go above and beyond to make sure you leave feeling satisfied. Shout out to R Ali who made my last visit one to remember!"
