1,Now Open: Meat Us at @boucherienyc in the West Village #ipsnews #boucherie #dining #nyc #newyorkcity #westvillage http://fb.me/8w71zIdU6
2,"Terrible place for anyone with food allergies. I have a gluten allergy, and after the server assured me my food would be ok for me to eat, it still had gluten in it and I got very sick. DO NOT eat here if you have an allergy!!!"
3,"Took my mum for a last night in NYC dinner based on the reviews.  Service so incredible slow. Lots of staff but it’s like they don’t know what they are doing? One pours water and you give them a wine order and 15 minutes later someone different comes and asks what wine you wanted then someone else’s asks if you have your wine then chases someone different to give the wine.  Food was ok, no as amazing as we were expecting based on the reviews but it was OK.  Service was the real let down. No check back on if food was ok or if we needed anything, our empty plates were left with us for nearly an hour it was only when we gathered them up to give more space on the table someone came to take them.  No one offered deserts, more drinks, coffee etc. Asked for the bill, paid and our waiter stood there as we left and didn’t even say goodbye despite the fact we still left him a tip, truly bad service and some staff really letting the establishment down."
4,"My fiancé and I visited Boucherie at the start of January on our city break. I was looking forward to it as we had lunch in Petit Boucherie when we were in the city last summer and it was great. Having flown from London we were both really tired and needed a pick me up and boy did this meal deliver. We had the French onion soup to start which I have to say is probably one of the tastiest things I have ever consumed. I burned my mouth as I couldn’t wait to eat it (totally worth it). We both had the steak frites cooked medium rare, accompanied by a glass of Bordeaux recommended by our friendly server. The steak was spot on cooked to perfection. We washed it all down with a couple of la vie en rose cocktails and took in the decor and glamorous vibes. Up there with the best in the west village. We try not to repeat restaurants while in the city as there are so many amazing places to eat but we will most definitely return when we are back in NYC."
5,"The local cuisine was fantastic and authentic, just how I loved it in Italy. The service was top-notch. Our experience was made wonderful by the employees and management. Without a doubt, we'll return!"
6,"Dinner for. Family of four. Two of us had steaks which were perfect, the other had the duck confit and the burger, of which they both enjoyed. The users of Letitia salad, truffle fries and purée potato accompanied the mains well. Wine list is extensive but reasonably price. The dining room is beautiful and has a great ambience. Service was efficient and helpful. Would definitely go here again."
7,"We'd pre-booked this Restaurant from the UK using OpenTable having done so much research using Trip Advisor that we were really looking forward to our visit. The only issue for us was what we'd describe as a somewhat 'Edgy Neighbourhood', maybe I'm going soft but forewarned etc. Anyway this was 'An Oasis' absolutely rocking with laughter & merriment from a pretty full restaurant. The Restaurant is a typical French Brasserie with the most fantastic Bar and hot grille producing perfectly cooked steaks. Serving Staff were attentive, helpful & friendly. I suppose the only 'Eye Watering Moment' on Xmas Day was pondering how the 'Boucherie' could justify a Butcher's Platter @ $315. A great choice of restaurant on Xmas Day & really happy with our choice of restaurant & food choices. Superb Xmas Day Meal. Atmosphere Service"
8,"My family and I visited here today, and it was fantastic!! I came here after a friend recommended it to me. Wow"
9,Everything was amazing! The onion soup and the duck was just perfect! So far one of the best meals that I had before! All the people and the service is good!
10,"Anniversary dinner made extra special by the staff during Christmas week. We asked for a cozy corner table away from the crowd and the restaurant seated us upstairs which was perfect! Service and food were outstanding. We started with salads and had the mussels and ribeye. Ordered dessert which was served with a special “happy anniversary” chocolate on top. Very relaxing, romantic evening. Thank you Boucherie!"
11,"My favorite restaurant at NYC love the porter house and the dessert, my waiter was the best, perfcet spot for a date."
12,"My new favorite restaurant! The food, drinks, and service were all amazing! I can’t wait to come back! Akin is the best!"

14,"I absolutely loved it, its a cool place, with delicious food and lots of flavour, i will definitely return, recommend it a lot!!"
15,"Me and my Friends who’s visiting from out of town, came dine here last Saturday, this Restaurant is amazing from the moment that we came, its so festive. Although its super busy when we got in the hostess are very friendly and hospitable zara and karoline ( i think that their names), the food is just superb we got the big cuts to share.our server is amazing i forgot her name. And definitely we will come back again."
16,"The food, the atmosphere, the music, the service, everything — spot on. I would eat here every day if I could. 10/10 recommend!!!"
17,"Food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. It’s a beautiful place to visit, great service as well!!"
18,"Food was excellent for all. Salmon, filet, and steak fritz. Also enjoyed the creme brûlée for dessert. Service was much quicker than anticipated for a French restaurant. Highly recommend."
19,Went to this place with friends for lunch and it turned out to be such a delightful experience. Their North Indian food is exceptionally good. All their dishes were so mouthful and had perfect blend of flavours. I tried the following: Tikka Platter - special mention to beetroot
20,"This is a very cozy French restaurant in the heart of West Village, the atmosphere was very elegant and lovely, they have pretty big outdoor space and bar area. The service here was amazing, our waiter Ashley was super friendly and sweet, he took care of us really well. The food and drinks were fantastic, everything we ordered, they were tasty and delicious. French Onion Soup and New York Strip Steak were amazing. They also have great desserts here. This will be a great spot to spend time with friends and family, especially for holidays the christmas decorations with the big tree in the middle of the dining room gives this place a very cozy and unique atmosphere. Definitely will be back"
21,Our seventh visit to this spectacular restaurant. The ambiance and food is on point. I recommend the escargot appetizer and Entrecôte Grille (Australian grass-fed ribeye). One of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan.
22,"Visited with my adult daughter Thanksgiving Day. I'm 67, so arriving early, and like ther baby boomers, have high frequency hearing loss, making it difficult to hear especially women's voices, and where there is background noise, so they seared us in one of those NYC-COVID,ERA additions, but as festively Christmas decorated as main restaurant which is huge.Server, Sommelier, stakk, impeccably dressed and consummate professionals. Actually using word like ""sir:, and Mr Dillon. Ordered two person Chateau Briand with the 3 available sauces, Bearnaise, Peppercorn, and I forget the last, like a demi-glass, escargot fries, onion soup, all among best anywhere in the world, and a bottle of champagne, stored for us, monitored. Served. Just a terrific Thanksgiving. But recommend as a treat, any time."

51,"my friends and I had an amazing time visiting here. The drinks were amazing, the staff was incredibly friendly, the food was divine… and the butter was out of this world. A must-stop destination!"
52,"I can not understand how this place has so many good reviews. I was in the city visiting my daughter who goes to college nearby, and chose based off the reviews that was my first big mistake.  The inside interior is okay (lots of fake plastic things hanging from the ceiling), in no way shape of form an upscale French Restaurant ( I have been to France). My steak looked like a steak from any chain steak restaurant, it had 0 seasoning and presentation was awful. $60 for a ribeye steak (overcooked and now where close to Medium) and it came with lettuce (just lettuce on a plate- nothing else). I couldn't believe it, this place is 100% overpriced, the food is average at best, nothing blew me away aside from a very nice waiter and a great glass of wine. A great day with my daughter in the city ended with a terrible overpriced meal.  Beware of these reviews, I noticed most of them are by people who have never reviewed anything on trip advisor except this place."
53,Great spot in the west village. Cool staff — Alejandro makes a mean sazcerac. Definitely a good place to stop when in the neighborhood!
54,"Visited my daughter for the day who attends college in New York, chose the restaurant based on the reviews. Very disappointed especially for the cost. I ordered the Ribeye which arrived over cooked very bland and accompanied by lettuce( just lettuce). For $60 I would expect a great looking steak and a vegetable or something. My husband had the Wagu burger and it was bland and the presentation was no better than any chain restaurant. My daughter had the steak frites and it was the same no seasoning or anything special for the cost. Bill was over $240, I can not understand how this place is rated so high and so well."
55,"The ambience is really great! Great wine list, i ordered the mussels and french onion soup. Love them!"
56,"It‘s a really nice and fancy place to eat. We had some difficulty at the beginning with orderinf food but worked out fine. The meat was amazing and looked great as well. In my opinion its a bit too crowdy, to many tables inside. The waiter really had some difficulties to walk around."
57,Lovely vibe! Either you are at the bar for an old fashion or enjoying an filet mignon on their very “French” styled table you will have a blast. The ambience sound keeps it stylish and the vibe up.
58,Perfect atmosphere for a night out of town. Service was great and food was even better! Our waitress was also so accommodating of food allergies. We had our tomahawk steak dairy free and gluten free. We enjoyed it! Everything was great !
59,"This places had it all, amazing food, ambience, authentic French dishes — the service was second to none. Quick tip, the cheese boards (frontage and charcuterie) are larger than normal!! I was expecting a little piece of cheese as a light starter but the portions were healthy. Highly recommend"
60,"Amazing ambience, food, cocktails, & service! I felt like I was transported back to Paris! I cannot wait to visit again ❤️"
61,"Great ambiance, amazing cocktail selection. Get the foie gras!!! Great neighborhood. Easy to get a table on a busy night."
62,"My wife and I had the pleasure to dine here on Friday night. We love this restaurant! We were warmly greeted by the super friendly staff , the ambience hit all of my senses , cool music, awesome decor , servers buzzing about, the open kitchen firing food. It was a wonderful feeling. I couldn’t wait to begin my experience. I felt like I walked into a Parisian restaurant. I have to mention the staff ,Akin our server was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu, Sofor was always on hand too and the mgr Maja was constantly checking on all guests. The food was delicious, I started with a classic French onion soup , steak frittes and finished with cappuccino and the tart au chocolate with 23k gold leaf I was so comfy and relaxed sipping my Gamay. I also loved that they have an area in the front with tall glass ceiling and at night they have soft lighting throughout. I definitely recommend this restaurant, thank you for a wonderful experience!"
63,This is a truly exceptional restaurant!!! The food is superb. The service is good. A large tree occupies the center of the restaurant. The Men's Room warrants improvement though.
64,"Fantastic service and amazing cocktails! The perfect place to go after a long hard days work! Lovely location and great vibes, plus the Wagyu burger is the best!"
65,"Excellent food, drinks and service! Great for big group of friends - seated quickly. Had a super fun time! We love you and this was great"

67,"Omg, SUCH an excellent experience!!! The salads (Caesar & mixed salad chèvre chaud) were really flavorful, the steak (filet!) was perfect & exactly as advertised, and the desserts were a-MAY-zing!!! Not to mention, the sommelier steered us to EXACTLY the right wine that made everyone HAPPY!!! Shout out to Akin, our waitperson who was outstanding, too!!!"

92,"Atmosphere great! Dinner before comedy cellar show with my son. He enjoyed the steak frites. I could not eat the escargot. Too mushy to the tongue. Left half uneaten. I ordered the fillet. Very strange consistency. It was like they pressed it together. Didn’t cut like a fillet. I’ll preface with I only buy beef tenderloin fillets at home and cook on our grill. I sent back the fillet thinking that if it was cooked more it wouldn’t have that squishy consistency. Unfortunately it still did. Atmosphere great, service good, food less than mediocre."
93,"Brought me and my 7 other friends here for my birthday and we had such a wonderful dinner!!! The food was delicious and the staff was great. Ambiance was fantastic! If anything, the general service could have been a bit better but Alex our waiter was amazing!!"

99,The decor here is gorgeous. Different type of room to have a party. I personally love the mezzanine and wine room booking for birthday with my friend and family while enjoy the most delicious food curated by Boucherie.
100,"The food is incredible- I got the duck confit and WOW. Service was fast and the restaurant is beautiful. I tried a little of what my friends ordered too and EVERYTHING was incredible- literally the most savory food I’ve ever had.

102,"Came here with the family in July 22. Our waiter knew the menu well and ensured we knew what to order to have a good experience. Each dish was well prepared and portion sizes were good. Get the steaks, as this places does it's protein's very well. We splurged and had the creme brûlée, which was well done. Will go back again."
103,"Not sure how this is number 6 out of 8,000 restaurants plus in NYC, but here goes my review… Ambiance was nice. We went Sunday evening at 8:00. Not busy at all, so had concerns about all the available tables. Food was good. Service was good. Was this a number 6 out of 8,000 no way. Not sure how this got such a high ranking? I had the filet mignon which was good not great and my husband had the steak frites. Also good but not great. My husband owns restaurants in Fl. He always asks was there something craveable on this menu that you want to come back for. Unfortunately this was just ok. I was hoping for craveable and a “great” response. Oh well. Bon appetite!"
104,"Atmosphere is incredible, design and service creates a special French touch. We have started with glass of champaign and it was a right choice. Then duck confit with glass of rose wine. Beautiful memories."

We went there for dinner on a saturday night and found it to be very noisy and stressful - we do like a lively restaurant but this was simply too much.

As someone who’s work in the restaurant industry, I know the there’s expectation to be met when working and she exceeded them all. The food was hot and delicious.

222,"Amazing drinks and good! Ordered the Provence martini it was amazing, our bartender Michelle did a great job! Our waiters mustafa and Akin made out light. Would highly recommend this spot"
223,I was here several times during my NYC trip. The food is very delicious and the service is very helpful. The cocktails are also great. You must try la vie en Rose. I totally recommend this place and look forward to coming back again here soon!
224,"I had the most incredible experience ever and it was largely in part due to Jacob. From the moment I walked in he immediately greeted me and asked me how I was. He stayed present throughout our entire service as the manager. He popped back in and insisted on treating us to dessert, which he ensured we would love (and we did). He was the cherry on top of our experience. Of course the food was divine and the cocktails enchanting."
225,"After a day of light shopping, me and my friend who haven’t seen each other in months were looking for a nice steak dinner — Boucherie didn’t disappoint.  We were welcomed by our lovely waitress Gabby who made sure we had a great time catching up while devouring some great eats. A beautiful porterhouse for 2, flights of wine, and a nice open air environment was a great way to celebrate the warmer Spring weather and friends getting back together.  This place is a staple and def will be coming back as things get a little more vibrant. Come early evening and stay until late — you won’t regret it!"
226,"Fantastic food. Amazing server, Gabby made our dinner and drinks perfect. From the escargot to the porterhouse to the dessert. Looking forward to coming back."
