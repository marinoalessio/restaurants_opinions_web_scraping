3,@NYCMayor I've been to your city it's not fair it's certainly not safer it is dwindling down to be a garbage alley. At one time New York City stood for so much now it stands for very little mostly debauchery shame on you
4,Thank you for sharing this story. My grandfather who was born in 1898 told us stories of back alley abortions in New York City when he was little in the early 1900s. It is an absolute shame and a crime #scotus made this choice!
5,"Then why bother half assing it? Its so little effort to just take it outside in a real alley, the movie was filmed in new york city."
6,—a dark alley. He thought for sure this might have been even a little more challenging but what do you honestly expect for New York City. Everyone is so preoccupied with themselves and their lives they barely notice what is going on around them.—
7,"Favorite place to bike in the city?Alleys. My favorite alley is in Irvington, between New York and Leslie Streets, east of Ritter. It is a short little thing, maybe a 1/4 mile at the most, but it feels like another world back there."
8,The Location in Oswego City New York wasn't do too well for you guys anymore there is a little bit of Property near KFC for sale where the Bowling alley was
9,"I’m being partially facetious—I know what I suggest is unrealistic. But it’s insane that it’s unrealistic. It’s normal in a lot of cities, like London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, etc.Even with little frontage, could have an alley/atrium, or just larger retail like grocery"
10,"I love that alley...drop 5 gallons of H20 and they will scramble away right quick...New Orleans, NewYorkCity, how we did it. No harm, no foul, just a little water"
11,"The phrase ""Too little too late"" is in my head as I see Facebook posts of a WEDDING hosting over 150 guests taking place in New York City. And that's nothing compared with a restaurant funneling diners into their place through an alley side door. N.Y. doesnt take it seriously."

14,(cont'd)-most interesting champion with a diverse team (sorry cynthia i find you very boring)-there's so much shit to do in this region i love it-perfect take on new york city and i like the little alley cafe -idk honestly i just like using psychic types the most
15,I’m open to do abortions you don’t have to be a doctor professional in New York to do abortions so I think I’ll get me a little room in an alley and I’m open for business New York you are now treading on dangerous ground it seems your city has no morals #NewYorkAbortions

29,"@davidbadash Tornado watch? In New York City? That's a bit odd. But having lived in Tornado Alley a while, a ""watch"" means little to nothing"
30,Last Saturday we lunched at Little Alley. I had eaten here several times and wanted friends to enjoy the food too. Carole ordered the Shanghai Pan Fried Noodles which unfortunately did not have enough vegetables but consisted mostly of thick noodles. Eden had an Eel dish that she enjoyed. I savored Crystal Shrimp Dumplings with delicate translucent skin that melted in my mouth. For a main course the sautéed green beans with pork and dried red chili was both pungent and aromatic. The ladies had lychee martinis which wasn’t traditionally made and I had a glass of rosé wine. We stayed to enjoy a lovely meal where the service was good.
31,"Excellent Shanghainese gem in Murray Hill. The soup dumplings are delicious - great taste, soup and the right proportion of filling. The sausage fried rice is not oily at all. The pak choy was really fresh and nicely stirfried. Chicken dumplings were also really good. Just don’t order the shrimp dumplings - as expected it is not Shanghainese food so not of the same quality."
32,"Back to Little Alley after two years on our first visit back to NY - certainly wonderful to see that it's weathered the storm of the pandemic. We were meeting some friends who'd never been here before so it was also good that the place accepts reservations. Inside it seemed the decor is a bit different, maybe simpler than before, and at least on this evening didn't see anyone at the dumpling station making them on the spot although the station is still there so maybe they still do it on certain days.  This is the week when most pandemic restrictions are eased but the tables here still seem more distanced than before which is good. On a weekday evening at 6 it was relatively quiet but by the time we left the place was full. We ordered the soup dumplings (very juicy), ma lan tou (good presentation but the greens not as fragrant as I expected), bean curd wrap, Shanghai Shuma (very good), sweet and sour pork (very crispy), chicken with hot chili and griddle prawns - the last two were super spicy, you wouldn't expect such heat from a Shanghainese restaurant, the griddle prawns had enough chili peppers in them to flavor a couple more dishes (which was what I did - packed up the leftovers with all the chili which provided abundant tasty seasoning for a couple of veggie dishes back home). Prices seem a bit higher than before - we averaged about $45/pp before tip."
33,Came here with my mom who grew up in Shanghai. We both absolutely loved the food and she confirmed that it is truly authentic Shanghainese style.  The waiters were super nice and very attentive. The cutlery matches the restaurant style and decor.  Long story short- a restaurant that should be on your NYC restaurant bucket list!
34,"Extremely friendly staff, clean restaurant, great ambiance and the food is amazing at a reasonable price for NYC. I recommend it for business or family diner/lunch."
35,Little Alley had always been on my list of Chinese restaurants to try. Now as they are featured in the 2021 Michelin Bib Gourmand awards I thought it was best to try it. Both visits I had the soup dumplings. The skin is far too thick unlike the excellent ones at The Bao but the meat and broth are quite tasty. A lunch special of green beans with ground meat had lots of red chili skins in it. It wasn’t hot for me but I felt that the meat was not enough although the beans were nicely blustered. Hot and sour soup and a spring roll came with the lunch. The brown rice was tasty. Service is attentive here. The interior lacks charm but now they are in the Michelin Guide which is a plus point. Regular menu items are quite expensive.
36,"Sorry we did not find this previously - now only get to nyc yearly. Former residents of the area - need to get our ""city fix"" whenever we can."
37,"Meeeh. Good food but this is NYC...there are plenty of better Chinese restaurants in town. And compared to what it offers, way overpriced. Sorry..."
38,We have been here about four times and everything we have had has always been delicious. My favorite dish is the minced mushrooms wrapped in tofu skins.
39,A nice and relaxing ambient where to eat delicious dumplings. Fried or steamed. Veggie or meaty. Dry or juicy. The mune offers many choice.
40,"We tried their dishes twice recently. One time at the restaurant one time take out.  Xiso Long Bao was acceptable, Stir fried beef was soggy, we anticipated a crispy dish. We have now learnt that always ask before order.  For the take out we ordered pork dumplings - awful dish with thick dough cover. Fried rice - nothing special Spring beans with minced Pork - bad Sautéed Chicken with Chili - really not very much chicken - 90 % chili and small burnt chicken pieces!!!  The rating has improved from C to A the food and dishes has gone from B to D!"
41,"This restaurant is described as ""a Shanghainese chef's place for soup dumplings & traditional plates in a brick-walled setting."" While visiting NYC, this restaurant was recommended by a friend. The food is outstanding!!! We ordered marinated cucumbers for the appetizer. For lunch, we ordered shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings and Tsunami Shelter Garlic Shrimp. Everything was so good, service was great. It seems that some of the wait staff speaks Mandarin, which was a pleasant surprise to an older couple that came in for lunch after we were seated, and had a grand time speaking Mandarin with the wait staff."
42,"The service was good but the food is only OK: nothing wrong it with it, but nothing was great either."
43,The food is very good and tasty. Tried the scallion pancakes and the soup dumplings. Enjoyed all of them. Service was prompt and friendly and the restaurant has a nice ambiance.
44,"Our first day in Manhattan we met our buddy who works in town for lunch. He found this place on Zagat and said let's try it. Yea, team! We got there about 1:30 so not crowded. We had the crab soup dumplings to start $10, yum! My wife and I had the Pork in Garlic Sauce ($11 each) which we loved. Our friend had the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce (10) which I tried and give a thumbs up. Our dishes came with Spring Roll, rice and a baby cucumber soup as a rice for my wife (she loved) With tea, diet coke and chardonnay for my wife we clocked out at $71.33. In my mind a brilliant use of money. I give it a five for delicious great value."
45,"The service was prompt, but the food leaves tus be desired. It was so so but everything we ordered was rather bland. The least bad was the wonton soup. I had potential to be much better."
46,"What a surprise to find this wonderful little restaurant with Shanghai cuisine in midtown Manhattan! Some of the best soup dumplings I have ever had, made fresh daily by a lady in the back of the restaurant. Delicious and different creative cocktails. Extensive menu with dishes that one rarelty sees in Chinese restaurants. Really enjoyed the perfectly prepared cod with mushrooms and ham, as well as the perfectly prepared pea shoots sauteed in garlic. I cannot wait to return to try other dishes, vegetables and dim sum."
47,We were in NYC experiencing Christmas time and looking for a place for quick food. We googled and chose this place just two blocks away. Such a cute place with very friendly service. The food served very fast and we were super satisfied.
48,"Great Chinese/Shanghai food. Most of the dishes we tasted (we were 6 and ordered to share - which is recommended) were great, if not outstanding. Kind of nice vibe in the restaurant, casual, family friendly and service was very on point. Not the best service in the world, but very good. Recommend as it is also not too expensive."
49,"Little Alley offers delicious Chinese food with an emphasis on dishes from the Shanghai region of China. The menu is large with appetizers, entrees, rice and noodles dishes as well as dim sum. The restaurant is small so reservations are essential. In one corner of the room a chef is preparing dumplings which are then sent back into the kitchen for steaming. All of our choices were very flavorful. Make sure your chopstick skills are practiced before you go. There is a full beer/wine/cocktail menu. Service was very professional and prices were reasonable."
50,We visited this restaurant the first time last year. The food is not bad but why the C rating? This C rating has been all the time since they started to get rated. Why do they take away the C rating sign quite often?  I asked them regarding the rating and was told it was because that the staff in the kitchen did not have a cap or a hat on!!! C rating means in this case 37 violations. Is it safe to visit this place?
51,"We had just got of the plane and half settled And usual hungry for Asian food. Found my earlier review from last year and guess what... we had the same set up last year which is valid for this visit as well!  We ordered and shared Crab Soup Dumplings, Pot Stickers and Shredded Pepper Steak. Fantastic. The dumplings were excellent as well as the other dishes. If you are afraid of hot spicy food order medium spicy. We love spicy food and mixed the chili with soy sauce. Mmmmmm"
52,"An excellent Chinese option for Midtown East, their specialty is Pork Dumplings. I don't recommend the chicken it has a lot of bones. For a lunch in winter is perfect."
53,"I ordered delivery so don't know what the physical restaurant is like. The food was above average, slightly greasy but flavorful. We had shanghai noodles with beef and shrimp, garlic eggplant (very greasy), and vegetable dumplings. More than enough for two hungry adults. Delivered by ChowNow, hot and on time as specified in the online app."
54,"Upon my arrival to the restaurant, we were placed in the corner of the restaurant, right next to the bathroom. However, the staff were very helpful and they then seated us in the front, right next to the dim sum creation station.  Not only were the staff extremely helpful, but the food was superb! I particularly enjoyed the dim sum, as they were all freshly made. The dumplings are very juicy, so it is evident that they have been expertly made. As main courses, the seafood is a speciality since this restaurant specialises in Shanghai cuisine. Specifically, the steamed sea bass is unmissable. The noodles are exceptional and they contain very fresh vegetables, to my surprise. While the crispy duck was satisfactory, I would not recommend it- rather, load up on seafood. Lastly, the sweet and sour ribs (which we orderer hot) were a fantastic start to the meal.  The atmosphere is very inviting. There were two large groups when I was there, and many 2-people and 4-people tables. The ambiance is quite dynamic.  All in all, top notch Shanghai cuisine- cannot be missed!"
55,"Give me a break, what restaurant adds a ""convenience charge "" to the bill and says nothing about it? What if I was paying in cash instead of credit. Anyway it's totally inappropriate to charge the customer extra for using a credit card, especially 4.5%!  Beware of these guys! And by the way, the city inspectors have them a grade of C.  Not that I got that off my chest, the food was ok, nothing special.  I will never go back again due to their sleazy convenience charge. If you go, be sure to review the bill carefully. I deducted the convenience charge from the tip. Let the waiter and the owner work it out between them.  Nuff said!"
56,We stumbled across this little gem by an off chance. We had 4 dim sum between the two of us and there was plenty. It was absolutely delicious! The service was great and staff were very attentive. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting NYC.
57,"4 Shanghainese dined here and we all approved it. Excellent Shanghainese food for outside Shanghai NYC standard. Dishes are good size to be shared by 4 people, not too big so you can try a few."
58,"This is a fairly new restaurant (opened last year) and probably the most atmospheric in an otherwise nondescript neighborhood. Decided to come here on this visit to NY after reading a review about it in the New Yorker. Good thing we made a reservation as at 7 on a Sunday evening the place was packed and walk-ins could only sit at the bar (they also require the entire party to arrive before seating). The dining room is small but not bad by NY standards. Seating is tight but not uncomfortably so. Decor has the stylized Shanghai ""alley"" motif, palette in multiple shades of grey, the address of the place in Chinese characters on square plaques hanging by the entrance. Diners were overwhelmingly Asian and young - clearly a currently trendy place among this demographic. Waitstaff seemed to be of the same - unusual given the multi cultural trend in many modern Asian restaurants in NY.  We had a table right by the small corner station with one single staff tirelessly making the renowned XLB ""soup dumplings"", so that was quite entertaining. We ordered standard Shanghai favorites from the extensive menu - XLB, pan fried meat buns, ma lan tou, fish in wine sauce, Chinese spinach in fermented bean sauce, chili chicken (more a Sichuan dish but is pretty much ubiquitous), and for dessert, the sticky rice stuffed lotus root. Overall, everything tasted authentic, and despite some reviews noting the XLB being ""ok but not the best"" I found them to be quite satisfactory and met expectations in size, dough skin thickness and juiciness. The portions are pretty small but I guess that goes with the territory of trendy places, and the lotus root dessert could be sliced thinner, but overall it's a pretty cool place with good food served in an interesting environment - as price to quantity ratio goes, no doubt not as good value as older Chinese restaurants around Chinatown but nevertheless worth trying at least once for the more contemporary ambience (we averaged $35/pp with moderate amount of food and one drink each before tip)."
59,"Even though Little Alley looks quite modern, it still feels quite small and authenthic. When i was there, there were mostly asians eating. I had a noodle dish that was good and some dumplings, which were very spicy but tasted nice too. Staff was very friendly."
60,"I had been wanting to try this place for a while because of the giant soup dumpling. Unfortunately, they didn't have it when we went. My aunt, my sister, and I came in on a Monday at around 6:30. The place was pretty empty at that time but it started filling up at around 7.  We ordered a bunch of stuff to share:  Drunken Chicken (chicken in yellow wine) - didn't care for it, because I don't like my food tasting like alcohol (my aunt wanted to try this one)  Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs - this was pretty salty. There was no way that it could be eaten without a bowl of white rice, which we promptly ordered as soon as we tasted it. The sauce it comes in is also way too thick and gloopy.  Pork Soup Dumplings - pretty good, but not the best I've had  Shanghai Stir-fried Thick Noodles (shrimp, shredded Pork, shredded shiitake mushroom, bok choy, thick noodles) - I actually enjoyed this dish. It was probably the best one out of everything. However, the portion was small and I don't think it was worth $16.  Overall verdict: overpriced, mediocre Shanghainese food. But if you can't make it down to Chinatown and are willing to shell out the extra $$$, then Little Alley is not the worst option in the city.  Tip - if it's your first time dining there, you can go online and sign up for their mailing list for 10% off the bill. I did this but forgot to use it. Womp Womp."
61,"As regulars of Little Alley since several months and living in the area, we got very disappointed tonight : all prices went up on the menu (about $3 up for entrées, about $1 up for appetizers), affordable soup dumplings disappeared from menu, replaced by a limited choice of $10 soup dumplings. The total bill was as high as a very good Japanese or French restaurant. Furthermore, I used to order the Mongolian Beef which was always yummy. Tonight was half beef, half onions. Hope you guys will return to your previous price menu and recipes. Thanks."
62,"Little Alley is worth checking out if you are seeking to mix up your lunch hour. They offer really reasonably priced Shanghai-style Chinese dishes, but the menu is rather limited. My go to is the marinated cucumbers with the and fish and tofu in sichuan sauce."
63,This relatively new place is close to Grand Central. Excellent authentic Chinese food with Shanghai or Suzhou/Hangzhou flavor. Atmosphere is more trendy and comfortable than your average Chinese restaurants. Service is friendly and efficient.
64,"Good Shanghainese food in midtown east. Lots of traditional dishes. Enjoyed the tofu with mushroom and sesame sauce; soup dumplings, tofu with crab, lions' head meatball, and luffa with edamame."
65,"Varied menu, some Shanghai-like dishes (like soup dumplings), very tasty. Noise level can be high at time. Best with several people, so you can share dishes. Note: received a ""B"" rating, not ""A"" from NYC Health Dept."
66,The pork soup dumplings are out of this world. Also try cumin lamb. Very flavorful with just the right amount of spice for all of us spice lovers.
67,Met some friends here and had a great dim sum dinner in Murray Hill section of new york. Good dumplings as well as meat and vegetable dishes. Nice quiet atmosphere so we could hear ourselves talk and enjoy yummy food.
68,"Read quite many good reviews for this restaurant and was excited to give it a try. We ordered quite a few dishes. I would say the food is very authentic. Except the soup which was very hot and tasty, the rest of dishes seem to sit in the kitchen for a while before bring to the table. They are not hot enough. Even for soup dumpling, it was supposedly hot but I feel warm only. The rest of dishes are all with same issue. I was struggling whether to ask waiter to put into microwave to heat it up but finally gave up."
69,This restaurant has served both good Crab Soup dumplings and also reheated or microwaved of the same.  The spicy beef or shredded pepper steak is great and the red cooked chicken with sesame oil is also good. Let us hope that we will have fresh soup dumplings next time.
