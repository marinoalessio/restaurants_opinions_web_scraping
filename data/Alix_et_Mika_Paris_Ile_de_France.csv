1,"Found this little beauty from doing some research online and I can say I haven’t been disappointed. Such a nice warm welcome (especially for someone who can’t speak two words of French!), truly fantastic food (go for the Discovery Menu if it’s your first time like we did!) and really lovely atmosphere that built up shortly after we arrived at 8pm. Staff fantastic too and especially Mika, the part owner who made it an extra enjoyable evening. Bravo!"
2,"Friendly welcome, great food, very affordable and wonderfull wine list. What more could you want? It is all the way up in mortmartre but definitely worth the walk (mortmartre by night is great as it is). Definitely thé best tartares you'll ever have (and I am a chef so i think i Know what i am talking about ?)"
3,"I really liked the place, very welcoming, the owner was really nice, fast service, fair prices for Paris. The tartare is really good too as well as the fries. There is also a good choice of tartares for everyone."
4,"Wow wow and wow once again! This place was indeed a hidden gem. Loved everything about it, from the moment we arrived the owner greeted us very warmly. The place is small, but how the food is prepared and the treatment you get in the restaurant are definitely worth it. The tartar was simply magnificent, perfect seasoning and quality beef.  I can recommend this place fully to anyone going to Paris!"
5,"We were looking for a few drinks before our reveillon and found this charming cosy atmosphere shining through its giant glasswall. Initially ordered a glass each as an ""apero"" to enjoy the crowd of asians, brazilians and italians.  The service was surprisingly friendly, so much that we decided to order a tartare platter and loved it. Perfect beginning of a long night. We will come back!"
6,We reserved at this restaurant for the first night in Paris even if we did not know it! At first sight once we arrived we were a bit disappointed about the anonymous ambience but the quality of the food definitely made up for it! Delicious food and wine for a reasonable price! The waiter knows the good manners! I recommend the fix menu to share in 2 people! (we could share in 3)
7,"For the tartere savvy or merely curious, this might be one of the most unique and interesting culinary experiences available in this relaxed and niche restaurant. We highly recommend trying the menu for sharing at your first visit, where you get a tour of the different possible tartare combinations available. If you enjoy it, we recommend a sevond visit where you create your personal favorite tartare style and enjoy it as a main course. Truly a hidden gem."
8,"I consider this place to be such a hidden gem! Their food is amazing, especially the tartare, for the relatively cheap price, it's such a great food experience! Would definitely recommend it others and would definitely visit again! The owner was really nice too."
9,"My partner is a long standing steak tartare fiend, and it was the best she had ever had. It was my first time, and I was a little sceptical, but it was great to try something different and really tasty. The pana cota was also amazing"
10,"Meat and fishes were delicious! The same for burrata, and service was nice and great! You can go there without any doubts!!"
11,"Visited with wife for dinner. Great food , amazing service and awesome dessert ! Highly recommended !"
12,Super good for tartar-lovers and -beginers. Fries in duck fat was exelent and the staff were amazing. And do not forget desert.
13,A wonderful tartare dinner for one ‘meat eater’ and one vegetarian. Plenty of options for the tartare with a friendly and helpful service. Definitely would recommend
14,We were starving and stumbled across this place- super cute!! Service was amazing and the food was delicious. More for meat eaters but the veggie one of us also found her food delicious. Definitely check it out!!
15,"A friend’s recommendation and a wonderful concept convinced us to make this booking. And OMG did this restaurant deliver on all accounts. Food was absolutely divine, with super fresh ingredients and unique taste combinations offered in the way each tartar is meticulously brought to life. Service was done with care and kindness. I’ve been eating tartar since I was a kid (a few decades now, take my word for it), and this was definitely in the top 3. The beef croustillan and forrestier combos were unforgettably delicious, as was the salmon poke. Not only will we be back on every Parisian trip but we have now become those folks who recommend Alix et Mika to their friends. Well done and thank you!"
16,"My wife and I were directed to restaurant back in May 2022. What a great find!  The food, which was quite unique, fresh and fantastic, as well as the service were all top-notch.  I can't say enough about the mains and you really can't go wrong on anything you order. If you are unsure of what/how to order, even if you don't speak French, just ask, they will bend over backwards to help. They recommended great wine pairings too.  The entire staff (we met the kitchen crew after our meal on the way out) was incredibly nice and they were all concerned we enjoyed our entire experience.  The restaurant is on a quiet street, giving it a very nice neighborhood feel.  I can't say enough good things about this place. Next time we're in Paris, we will definitely return."
17,Chances upon this modern and clean restaurant online and was super excited by their menu. The food delivered and did not disappoint. Mika’s am excellent owner and incredibly friendly. Would be back here the next time we’re in Paris.
18,"If you want to try a great french restaurant with a nice atmosphere and fresh local food, this is the place you are looking for!"
19,Nice restaurant with lots of choice. Staff are friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The restaurant is in a nice street. I can thoroughly recommend this place
20,"Friendly service and awesome food and drink. Well worth a visit. We had the discovery menu for 2. We were given a well thought out guide by Mika on which order to eat, and he was helpful in answering our questions in our cobbled together French and his fluent English."
21,"This is a small restaurant in Montmartre at 37 rue Lamark that specializes in tartare (raw meat). The main part of the menu offers a variety of meats (salmon, beef, veal for example) that is prepared in any number of styles (about 15 different options): French, Italian, Mexican, Oriental, Greek, etc. You can order one, or a combo of three different ones. We ordered the salmon fixed in Italian style, and the beef fixed in a different style. The meat was incredibly tasty and tender. We also ordered a side salad, that was merely fresh lettuce with a light vinegar and oil dressing, and French fries cooked in duck fat. For dessert, our waiter offered us a dessert not on the menu, which turned out to be very thinly sliced fresh pineapple with a dulce leche (caramel) sauce drizzled on it and little toffee crumbles. It was very good and refreshing. We ordered a bottle of wine recommended by the waiter that we quite enjoyed. We recommend this restaurant if you are ok with Tartare. The total bill was about 75 euros, half of which was the wine."
22,"Data della cena: 15/lug/2017 Small restaurant in Montmartre...they only serve tartare. Great quality of ingredients (very fresh fish and meat), interesting combination of marinates and you can mix and match what you prefer.  We had a nice bottle of wine and some cheeses to finish. Good choice cos there weren't many desserts.  Friendly and young staff, very welcoming. Highly recommended to have something g different from the usual meals"
23,Alex and Mika mainly serves tartar of different meat or fish. All very fresh of course. The spicing used is very creative and extremely good. Highly recommended.
24,"Small, Hip, Friendly, Reasonably priced ....and above all Delicious! Pick your raw meat (beef, veal, tuna, etc), pick your flavoring/seasoning choice, add a side or two to share, and wine/cocktail. To be honest I forgot if they had English menu, but they spoke English quite well and had no problem ordering. Burrata salad appetizer, two tartars, two sides and bottle of wine was like 60 euros. Servings were larger than expected so we were stuffed. French Fries fried in duck fat were decadent and awesome. Still relatively new place, so as word spreads it will probably be harder to get seated."
25,"Of course you can order raw steak with frites anywhere in Paris. But this place is the best. The meat is fantastic and the way it is prepared even better. We were directed here by some fantastic French/Americain ladies, who have lived in Paris for donkey years. Great experience. If you can, go there. But do not forget to book in advance since the number of places available is very limited"
