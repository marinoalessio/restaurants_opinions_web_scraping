0,"I was staying nearby and came here every morning for breakfast. Quick, fairly cheap, good English breakfast things, and a great host. I just wish I had a bigger appetite in the mornings to go the full monty."
1,"Found out about this place from Trip Advisor reviews as an alternative to over priced hotel breakfasts. Takes a little bit of finding but trip advisor map helps with that. This is a small eatery under the arches of the minories. It doesn‚Äôt set out to be fancy but looks to offer good food in a friendly personable atmosphere. We went 3 days running and each time we were greeted like a long lost friend. Sid the ‚Äúfront of house‚Äù was so friendly and helpful. He remembered drink preferences, not just for us, but for every repeat visitor and was genuinely interested in doing what he could to make the start of each day a positive experience - it truly set us up for each day!"
2,Had a really delicious foccacia each and tasty hot chips. Good cappuccino and orange juice. Service was fast and friendly.
3,"After looking for a good place for breakfast before our visit to the Tower of London we looked at previous reviews of Devine and decided to give it a go ! We were not disappointed, it was great food , good prices and very friendly staff . Would recommend for a no nonsense breakfast stop"
4,"London's best kept secret best stay hidden. I don't get the hype, had plenty of meals (at least 6) here and none of them were worth the price, for 1 or 2 pounds more I can have much nicer food elsewhere. Neither myself nor my friend were able to finish the pasta it was overcooked and simply didn't taste nice. The sandwiches are fine, very mid, the chicken is very dry, the bacon looks grey, just not very appealing. Lastly they definitely don't serve everything fresh, you can't convince me some is this food is not a day or more old.  The proprietor is very friendly and I haven't tried the breakfast but I won't be coming back."
5,"To be quite honest I don‚Äôt really like any European breakfast coming from the US but my friend told me of a spot with good portions, amazing service, and a super random location.. so I came under a bridge and ending up coming to my favorite place! I mean I still don‚Äôt love the UK breakfast BUT this is for sure the best breakfast I have had in the UK and will come back every time I‚Äôm in London. I absolutely loved this spot, from prices to food to service. Everything was amazing. And sorry I didn‚Äôt take any pics I literally demolished the food once I got it haha but I got the full Monty and it was great!"
6,"This place is a hidden GEM! And when i say hidden i mean it‚Äôs located directly under a bridge, nestled into the wall but well worth the adventurous find! Get The Full Monty !! I promise you won‚Äôt regret it i couldn‚Äôt even believe how much food u get for how well it‚Äôs priced! Only 7 pounds for a full plate of everything you‚Äôd want! I substituted the fries (chips) for hash browns and the owner is absolutely the most accommodating person ever! So kind and patient and makes sure you have everything you need! Makes you feel at home seriously! He also made me the best cappuccino ever ‚Äç highly recommend! U won‚Äôt regret"
7,"Average food. Average cafe. I was very disappointed on my plate of food, mostly it was burnt and oily. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be coming back."
8,"Good food, enough variety to give us some choices and the owner is on site and manages a very tight ship. We were there for breakfast and they had enough items at much better pricing than the hotel around the corner. Excellent for locals and anyone visiting the Tower area of London. It's a bit of a hole in the wall so look it up first."
9,"I promised I would review this fabulous little place after a London visit in October and so sorry for taking this long! What a find this place was! My boyfriend Mick came across this place a stone's throw from The Tower of London. I was expecting a good but likely pricey breakfast. Instead we got an incredible huge and delicious breakfast which was really good value for money! The owner was wonderfully friendly - wow he could teach a lot of people about customer service! This man made us feel so welcome and like nothing was too much trouble. If I lived nearer I would be here more often! Thanks again and if you celebrate it Devine, have a wonderful Christmas!"
10,"Came across this fantastic place today when looking for breakfast near the Tower of London today, hidden away under a bridge, the owner was very friendly, polite and efficient. We felt welcome from the moment we walked in and everything was spotless. The tea was piping hot, as were the tasty English breakfasts and bap we ordered. The prices were spot on, an amazing find for the centre of London, highly recommended."
11,Great breakfast in an out of the way spot. Extremely friendly staff and reasonably priced. Just around the corner from the Tower. A great way to start your day!!
12,Great service and warmth from the De Vine crew. Good size portions. A friendly welcome and traditional english breakfast met us.
13,"Amazing food, very friendly people! Took a typical english breakfast and it was delicious. The people have been very friendly. I can raccomend this place!"
14,"A perfect way to start the day near the Tower of London. Fantastic service and equally fantastic food. Both meals were perfect, delivered fast and the service couldn't have been better. For anyone looking for a warm delicious breakfast at an excellent price to power you through this end of London, Devine is it."
15,"We stopped by DeVine twice during our week in London. Both times for a relatively quick breakfast to ensure we had plenty of energy for a day of exploring London. Our kids (aged 10 and 7) thoroughly enjoyed the eggs (scrambled plate and then the variation of the English Breakfast). We enjoyed the quiet out of the bustle atmosphere and the attentive owner who remembered out how we liked our morning coffee. Highly recommend for those looking for a well priced, tasty breakfast with a welcoming host."
16,"We had breakfast here , great value and quality breakfast and coffee. Very friendly staff , recommend this , it's well worth a trip and breakfast so.m7 h better than.tge hotel offerings in the area."
17,We visited DeVines Restaurant at the last day of our trip to London. The only downside was that we could only have breakfast there once! Food and drinks were delicious and also special wishes that could not be found on the menu were fulfilled (important when traveling with a four year old). We'll definitely come back as soon as we visit London again!
18,"One of the best breakfasts we had on our trip to Europe. Absolutely the best one we had in London. The staff are incredibly accommodating and kind, they make you feel like family. The food was amazing with great portions and the owner doesn't lie when he says it's the best coffee in London, it was the best one I had tried while over there. My partner and I both ordered the English breakfast and were delighted by the flavour and freshness of the food brought to our table.  After our meal the owner made sure we were full and stated that the two rules of the place were that you leave satisfied and with a full stomach, both promises were fulfilled. The owner then told us the perfect places for taking photos on our last day in London. Will absolutely come visit again during our next stay!"
19,"A very nice place for a good start of the day. Breakfast was delicious, cost-quality in perfect balance and a very nice environment thanks to the personnel. Keep up the good work and food! For sure we will keep in mind this placeüòÅ"
20,"Great food, atmosphere, service, excellent value for money. Authentic, local customers, very friendly owner. The best full English breakfast."
21,"Really friendly welcome and great food when we visited here last week. Extensive list of menu options, fast service, incredible portion sizes and good value. Next time we‚Äôre down in London, we‚Äôll definitely be paying a return visit."
22,We went to have breakfast and the owner gave us an excellent service and also recommend us really good meal options. I will come back for sure again in this trip
23,Fantastic service/Fantastic Food and always a lovely welcome. great prices and food is so fresh. The location is close to Tower Hill and very easy to find.
24,"Saw the great reviews and led my friends here to get our first taste of a full English breakfast. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint! The staff was amazing and recommended dishes, so personable and attentive. We left happy and full! Thank you for the genuinely great food! I can tell locals and newcomers alike love this place."
25,My wife and I were in vacationing in London early in Oct 2022. We had visited a museum in Whitechapel and wanted lunch. We looked on Google and saw that the Restaurant was not too far away. We found it under the railroad tracks. We were very heartily greeted by the owner who suggested various meals. My wife ordered the special and I ordered an omelette. Both items were so good tasting. That and the friendliness of the owner and staff made our afternoon. We will definately visit again the next time we're in town!
26,"Had a lovely cooked breakfast in Devine Cafe. Varied breakfast menu, food cooked to perfection, prices very reasonable, cafe very clean and owner so welcoming. The sandwiches looked delicious. Looking forward to going back on my next visit to London shortly."
27,A really great spot for a quick bite to eat. The owner/manager was really friendly. Will definitely be going back in the very near future! (Their homemade hot sauce was 10/10). Great veggie options on the menu.
28,"This is a lovely place. The food is delicious, and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. I hope to come back here next time I‚Äôm in City of London."
29,"Found by chance when looking online for places to eat near to where we were staying ( Tower Bridge) - what a great place. Warm welcome, excellent service from friendly people. A family run business with a personal touch and good prices too. Would highly recommend."
30,"Everything was really perfect; food, price, personal behaviour. Really enjoyed my time there. One of the best experiences in London‚ù§Ô∏è"
31,"I had English breakfast here. It was unbelievably delicious with very good price in compare of the similar places and more important, I had had a great experience by the staff nice behavior‚ù§Ô∏è"
32,The way they behaved us was really fantastic and the food was awesome. It included different type of delicious stuff and cheap
33,This was the best experience so far. The gentleman who waited on us was FANTASTIC! He was very friendly and a wealth of knowledge for sightseeing. The food was to die for. I had the full English breakfast and my husband had the Devine breakfast. This place is a definite stop for breakfast.
34,Went there for a coffee. Came back twice for the very charming and nice personal + great coffee and food. We'll recommend it to friends and family. Come to tower bridge and find this place. Hidden favourite here.
35,"We found this place hidden under the train tracks behind a hotel in London, and it had the most delicious food, everyone was so nice and helpful, and they customized to fit our needs that we ended up going there everyday of our trip! You can eat in or take away - you‚Äôll love either option!"
36,This is such a wonderful cafe. Perfect breakfast with happy and welcoming owner. If your staying in the city head here for breakfast which is likely to be better than at your hotel and less that‚Äôs half the price!
37,"Great food, simple and delicious. Just what we wanted, fast service and the owner/manager was so incedibly kind and obliging. Really cares about the customers experience, not just the food but the entire visit."
38,"Despite being understaffed we were acknowledged immediately upon walking in and told it would be a 10 minute way before they could get to us. No problem, we weren‚Äôt in a rush. You can tell by the steady stream of people this place is popular. Once they were able to get to us the service was great, no complaints. Breakfast was delicious and prices reasonable. Definitely stop by here."
39,"food was good , but staff have zero personality and the owner/manager is very ignorant and no customer service.. in fact very rude"
40,"Basic looking place with the best service. The owner was so attentive and nice, it definitely takes this place to the next level. I had the classic english brekkie and it was really as good as the other reviews say. We loved the relaxed atmosphere and, I believe the son of the owner, was helping that day and it was really sweet and funny to watch him behave like a real teenager - wishing he was at home watching TV or surfing the net, haha! Unbelievable value for money. I can recommend to everyone who is looking for a more traditional experience and not some fancy overpriced place."
41,"I would really like to recommend this place to eat. The staff is very friendly and the meals very good. The prices are also great and it's found on a perfect location, just a few meters from the London Tower. Must visit."
42,"A hidden gem and worth a visit. Food great, service great, welcome great‚ù§Ô∏è. If you want a true English breakfast this is your place to go!"
43,Good range of food at reasonable prices. Very friendly owner who makes you feel welcome. Excellent service. If you're in the Tower Hill area and looking for a great cooked breakfast to set you up for the day check it out.
44,"Absolutely a hidden gem in the City of London. Fantastic atmosphere and staff, very reasonable and affordable prices, and more than generous portions of delicious food. Would recommend De Vine for anyone from business people working in the area, to tourists, to students looking for a bite."
45,Don‚Äôt let the location fool you. It might be under the train tracks but it‚Äôs the best place to get a traditional English breakfast and tea. Excellent service and clean. Highly recommend a stop!
46,"My wife and I visited the cafe for breakfast on a day out to a show. I had looked on tripadvisor for somewhere to start our day off, and the De Vine stood out a mile, and we wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The owner was very friendly and the full English breakfast was served fresh and hot, the eggs were perfect, the bacon was really tasty and the little fat there was was nice and crispy, lovely plump sausage, mushrooms, beans, half a tomato and four halves of buttered toast, all for ¬£7.20 (bargain). We will definitely be going again next Thursday when we go and see Grease."
47,A hidden gem What an amazing place for breakfast the prices are great service stop on food was great Would definitely recommend this place and definitely returning
48,We stumbled upon this hole in the wall and sat for breakfast . The food was great the service was superb and the price was reasonable. Wow. So if your in the Towerhill area this is a spot you don't want to miss.
49,"We really enjoyed their service and food. Our trip was short, but we visited this place three times, because location is good, price is great and food is delicious."
50,We want black pudding and reading reviews for this place made us want to try it. Their place is literally under the train tracks. We were here for late breakfast and there were still quite a few people inside. We were greeted warmly and immediately got seated. We got the Devine breakfast (good size serving) and breakfast rolls. Both had black pudding. Very reasonably priced. Good size restaurant. Nothing fancy just good food and good service.
51,"I work in an office local to Devine Restaurant and frequently pop in for a coffee, breakfast or lunch. This place is tucked away under the railway arches but always has a steady flow of customers - mainly tourists but other office workers as well. Why? Firstly because the owner is a gentleman. He greets all customers with a warmth seldom seen in such places these days. Secondly, the food. Always good and thirdly it is great value - much cheaper than the chains with their never changing options. I would urge people - tourists or workers - to try out a proper, gem of a cafe/restaurant - supporting a small, brilliantly run business where they put your satisfaction at the top of their priorities. Thoroughly recommend!"
52,"The best place to take your breakfast and drink your coffee in a cosy place‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt miss it, and you will not regret it"
53,"Popped in for breakfast on a short city break. Great service, great coffee and a great fry up! Owner was very friendly and welcoming and runs a tight ship. Great to see places like this still exist. Don't waste your money on an overpriced offering from Pret a Manger or your hotel. Support local and you'll help places like this thrive. Highly recommend Devines! 5 stars!"
54,"A friend from the States was over and we needed someone to meet up for breakfast near Tower Hill.  A quick Google search came back with Devine. Keen for my friend to experience a real London cafe, rather than the normal Starbucks, Pret, etc. we agreed on it as a venue.  Arriving a few minutes early, I was greeted by the owner (Sukhjinder?) and made to feel immediately welcome. Seated at a table with a freshly made coffee I awaited my friend, and the owner brought over the extensive menu, including several specials, helpfully explaining that the menu above the counter contained the up-to-date prices.  My friend arrived a few minutes later and was quickly served with a coffee of his own. As it turned out it was just going to be me eating, and a full English promptly turned up that was perfectly cooked to order.  During our discussions over breakfast my friend asked how I had discovered Devine, as he was blown away with it - like me, he's travelled the world extensively and loves searching out traditional local eateries rather than all-too familiar global restaurant chains  Throughout our time in the restaurant there was a constant flow of customers, both eat-in and take-out, all of whom received the same level of friendly attention. Everyone seemed to leave with a smile on their faces!  I'd thoroughly recommend Devine, and my only regret is that I don't get up to London as much as I did pre-Covid, as watching the array of food being prepared and served I'd definitely love to sample some of the other choices on the menu.  For anyone wondering about the secret to a successful eatery, venture in and see how friendly and efficient service, great food, and a clean and enjoyable environment is still a winning combination.  Full marks all round!"
55,"Really good food. Best grub. Loads of option, flexibility with the menu to cater for needs and staff so friendly."
56,Lovely food and very good value for money. Very attentive service from who I think is probably the owner. Would definitely recommend.
57,"Yo cuz, yo food is fricking bustin' and yo th√© is focking nice! I love it cuzz! Well focking done!!!"
58,The full English breakfast and then some. Friendly attentive staff and very good value. Black pudding in London ! Highly recommended.
59,We were looking for something away from the usual hotel breakfast & found this place was well reviewed . The staff were so welcoming & friendly you just relaxed as soon as you sat down. Good breakfast choices & our food was tasty & plentiful. The owner was just a genuinely nice guy & I can‚Äôt think that we‚Äôll go anywhere else for breakfast on our next visit to London! My husband is still raving about the hot sauce he had with his breakfast!
