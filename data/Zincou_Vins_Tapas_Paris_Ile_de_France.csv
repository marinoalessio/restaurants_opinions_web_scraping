0,Will always thank my friend Jerome to introduce me to this place! I come often to Paris for work from Abu Dhabi and I did not know it.....I like to try a lot of small dishes and I never had the opportunity to try this type of concept with french cuisine. price is a bit high but I must say that the food is tasty and I like the atmosphere! A place to remember and will definitely come back
