1,"I‚Äôve been here a few times already with different friends and family, and it‚Äôs always been an excellent experience! The food is just delicious! Great service and atmosphere. As an Italian who lives in NY, I highly recommend this restaurant as one of the best and authentic Italian restaurants in the city."
2,This place is so amazing! The quality and service are top notch. My favorite Italian restaurant in all of NYC. The servers are so kind and the chef comes around to check often - he is very kind and passionate!
3,"‚Ä¶ Yes please! Service was impeccable, food was delicious. Yes reservations are required. My only one tiny complaint is that it was so hot inside for me, I should have worn a tank top Even though tables are super close to you, it doesn‚Äôt feel intrusive. It is very loud so your conversation can still somewhat be private. The artichoke appetizer was divine as well as whatever my sister got but I can‚Äôt remember ! It‚Äôs in my pic ;) Would definitely return and recommend."
4,"The service, staff, and food are incredible and the atmosphere is lovely. Have been going for years a"
5,"I was ecstatic to enter this well regarded eatery. Visits are undoubtedly worthwhile for the food. We ate lasagna, cacio e pepe, and a Greek salad. Both delicious and filling. The only issue would be the loud music, which felt more like it belonged in a nightclub than a restaurant. The server was also excellent and I will go back."
6,One of my favorite restaurants in nyc. Food is delicious and staff is just the best. Highly recommended for any occasion! My go-to spot in Soho!
7,Piccola Cuccina is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Love all their locations. Great food and service.
8,"This place is full of warmth, charm, and italian love. Food is amazing and this is our 3rd visit when we are in the Village and has become our favorite. Must go and plan accordingly in advance. You wont be disappointed, you'll meet new friends, and experience the authentic, fresh, deliciousness of Italy. Great for cold nights, cozy and warm! Amore!"
9,"My love story with this restaurant starts in NYC 4 years ago and since that time I've shot them all, even Ibiza and every time it was amazing! Chef Gioele is the top, a 100% Italian restaurant, it took such a place in the world! Go eat in this place!!!"
10,"Excellent food and vibe! The taste is really Italian, small and cute place for a date with your partner or friends. The chef and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. I will come back for sure!"
11,"We had a really good service. The octopus was great and soft, different from all the places I‚Äôve tried in NY. 10/10 recommended"
12,"La Piccola Cucina is hands down my favorite restaurant. Every single dish is out of this world, especially the pasta dishes. My personal favorites are the lasagne and the pasta ala norma. I've never had a pasta before with such a perfect texture, and this is what sets this restaurant apart from all the others‚Äìin-house made pasta and done with expertise you can taste.  I had the pleasure of meeting the head chef, Gioele La Rosa after the dish and even got to speak with him for a bit. This man is so passionate about what he does and you taste it in every single bite. I do not need to go to any other Italian restaurant as long as this one is around."
13,"I've been coming here since it opened before I was going to their locations in Soho. The food and service is outstanding, the pastas are out of this world . They have a nice outdoor seating area , and try their tiramisu . Never been disappointed ."
14,"We often visit the place to celebrate family and friends occasions. Last time we were there in October 2022 to greet a friend from abroad in NYC. The quality of food is always excellent, fresh, and delicious. That time we were nicely surprised with new staffed artichoke appetizer, highly recommend it. Also we had razor clams and calamarata pasta with branzino and almond. My regular favorite dish is fussily, it has amazing fish sauce I cannot resist. Go and try it!"
15,The ambiance and the food are great. Quick and professional service. I definitely recommend the place both for a business lunch or a night out with friends.
16,"I happened to drop by here and OMG I haven‚Äôt eaten such delicious food for a long time until now, at Piccola! The chef really knows what he is doing! One of my favorites from now on."
17,"A simple cuisine with very good food, a must to try is the involtini di pesce spada they remember me of home, great atmosphere and staff very friendly."
18,"bruh it was really good üòãüòã I got the octopus and pasta, it was delishhhhhhh, ragu I‚Äôm coming for you next time üò≠üíñ"

25,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in all of New York City. They make the most amazing food with fresh, high quality ingredients and the plating is always so gorgeous. Their pastas are the best that I've had and are always cooked perfectly al dente. All of their seafood dishes are delicious- especially the crudo. I have yet to have fresher seafood at an Italian restaurant. The desserts are incredible as well. The staff is super friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant is so cute and fun. You really feel like you're in Italy. Chef Gioele always created the most amazing specials and makes sure the dining experience is top notch. I bring all of my friends and family here whenever people visit and everyone has loved it every time. You MUST try Piccola Cucina Estiatorio! Make sure to book your reservation well in advance :)"
26,"If you want amazing food and an amazing time, this is the place. From good food to good wine to a good time."

Everything has that perfect and authentic italian vibe, the staff is very friendly and always make you feel welcomed.

40,"Excellent location and friendly and joyful environment. My wife and I stop by this place everytime we come to NY. Food is fresh, authentic from Italy. My wife a fish plate and it was superb.

45,"First time went to this restaurant for a dinner around a year ago with my friend. I lived in Italy when I was a kid, and in general love GOOD Italian food (and actually can say when it‚Äôs good). I was amazed! The taste, the presentation, the food, design in the restaurant (especially l‚Äôape Piaggio inside!!!) everything was fantastic!! Excellent service! And you have to try their cannoli, extremely delicious! I love to take my friends out there! It‚Äôs just perfect Definitely recommend you to visit Piccola Cucina!!"
46,"Piccola cucina never disappoints! I have been a handful of times from a friend‚Äôs recommendation and truly have not had better Italian food. We love going for special events like birthdays or just with a big group of friends. The vibes are great, good music, and phenomenal food - my favorite is the cacio e pepe. Highly recommend and always my go-to restaurant!!"
47,"If you‚Äôre looking for high quality food with reasonable price, this is the spot. They have an authentic Sicilian variety of pastas and seafood but without a doubt their wine selection and creative specials are the most outstanding points."
48,I come here very often here with my friends we really love the vibes here and the foods thanks to the Italian guys here the ambiance is amazing!
49,"This place is Our second home far from home. Me and my husband continue to come here to eat almost every week, here we enjoy the best food and company in the city. Especially the waiters makes you fell like their best friends, can‚Äôt change it with nowhere else. Sometimes the chef got inspired by Us and create a special dissert out of nowhere (just for me! ) will continue to come and come always ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"

60,"I live and work not far from this restaurant, they serve very good appetisers but even better pasta and what to say about the dessert? Simply yummy! I always crave them when i think of Piccola Cucina! Italian warranty... made in Sicily"

71,"This is my go to for Italian food in New York, a high honor! Everything I‚Äôve tried has been absolutely delicious. The food is so well prepared and authentic. Real quality Italian‚Äîa must try next time you‚Äôre in the mood. Save room for desert! It‚Äôs always the cherry on top of a perfect meal here."
72,Cannot rave about the food and experience at Piccolo Cucina Estiatorio enough! By far the best Italian (and Sicilian) food in the city. Atmosphere transports you to a small town in Sicily where grandma is in the kitchen and everyone is family that eats there. Thank you to Gioele for the absolutely best food and making us feel right at home.  Tutto era delizioso- la prossima volta porteremo pi√π persone perche stasera avremmo potuto sfamare un esercito! Grazie mille nostro amico.
73,"Hands down the best restaurant in the City. A perfect equilibrium of flavors from starters to dessert. You can tell from the first bite that products are genuine and quality superior. Better than many restaurants in Italy (trust me, I‚Äôm Italian).  Not only the food is delicious, but also the atmosphere is warm and the staff very welcoming and fun. If you have the chance, have a talk with Chef Gioele: he is a true master of the Italian cuisine and a very nice person."
74,"This restaurant is my go to place in the city.  The first time I went to Piccola Cucina Estiatorio it was during the pandemic and I felt in love with this spot since then. Not only I was very impressed by the nice atmosphere but especially by the great food. Italians are very picky when it comes to food, we know, and I have to say that Piccola Cucina made me felt like I‚Äôd never left Italy.  I go pretty often to Piccola Cucina Estiatorio and every time I‚Äôm always very torn because I‚Äôd eat all the menu! They have the best raw fish you could find. Carpaccio and tartare are absolutely my fav dishes. Therefore, their pasta is a master, each pasta you have on the menu is delicious and mouthwatering !  The last but not the least, get their tiramisu! They prepare it right in front of view and it‚Äôs terrific.  It‚Äôs always a pleasure to go to Piccola Cucina also because the chef and the staff are always very nice and they can recommend you very well. They are a great team I just wanna thanks them for doing such a great job and for making expats feel home!  Trust me, this place is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
75,Amazing food and vibes! Chef Gioele La Rosa is so passionate about making sure his food is of the highest quality and satisfies the tastebuds of every person who dines at Piccola Cucina.  It‚Äôs one of my favorite restaurants in SoHo. I highly recommend making a reservation and giving this place a visit!
76,Every time I go I have a fantastic time. The food is incredible and still holds my favorite pasta in the city the fusilloni langoustine!!! Everyone that works there is a gem. It‚Äôs always my go-to when friends or family is visiting me.
77,"As a Sicilian woman,I feel I can say this restaurant is definitely the most authentic Sicilian restaurant in the city. First of all the place it‚Äôs very cozy and warm and the food it‚Äôs delicious, it‚Äôs always my first choice when I m in the city and I want to eat Sicilian food!"
78,"As an Italian living in NYC, this is the only Italian restaurant I enjoy going to. Fantastic food quality and traditional but with a sophisticated modern take. Great work from Gioele and Team!"
79,Always love coming back to Piccola Cuccina! Best Italian food with a modern touch served by the most wonderful team and in such a great environment. Can‚Äôt recommend it more!!
80,Went most recently for a friend‚Äôs birthday but I‚Äôve been to every location and it‚Äôs consistently good although the atmosphere is definitely the most vibrant at the soho location. Everything is so delicious from the apps to the pastas! Love how many options there are and haven‚Äôt been let down with anything I‚Äôve tried. Favourite was the rigatoni pesto with lobster ragu
81,"Piccola Cuccina has the best pasta out of Italy üáÆüáπ Great prices, excellent service and an amazing atmosphere! My place to go for Italian cuisine!"
82,"I love this place ! Honestly for any type of occasion, very friendly for kids and families, amazing food and outstanding service. I come here religiously every two weeks even more often if I can ! Definitely 5 stars for everything!!!"
83,"One of the best Italian restaurants in NYC ! I come to eat here often. They are always wonderful with their hospitality, service, and freshness and taste of food. I love you Piccola Cucina !"
84,"The authentic Italian food in NYC. The pasta was incredible, particularly the handmade ravioli filled with ossobuco! The chef and the staff are very cool. The wine selections was interesting, with a lot of choice among small and big wineyards all around Italy"
85,Recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint. Great service and great food. We had an amazing time!
86,"Best restaurant in NYC. we‚Äôve been coming here for years and it‚Äôs spectacular every time! We love the chefs, hosts and everyone in between!"
87,Showed up for our 730pm reservation on time. Patiently waited outside in a chilly wind tunnel for 25 minutes with no follow-up. Entered to get an update and encountered zero empathy. Was seated about 5 minutes later. The crowd has deteriorated from cheerful locals to obnoxious tourists. We decided to leave. It‚Äôs too bad the food and service used to be great we‚Äôve visited this location many times over the past decade or more. Very disappointing experience.
88,The best pasta and fish in NY üòç I love eating there not only for the dishes but also for the atmosphere created by Chef Gioele and his team‚ù§Ô∏è
89,"My daughter took us here on our last night in NYC. What a treat! We didn‚Äôt have a reservation but they could accommodate us. The restaurant is cute and quaint. The service was great. The food was delicious. We got the grilled calamari and I thinks it‚Äôs the best Calamari I‚Äôve ever had. We ordered two pastas and a salmon tartar. Everything was delicious. The rigatoni with pesto and lobster melted in your mouth. But what was especially nice was one of our party could not eat dairy and the staff went out of their way to ensure that his dish was dairy free. And last but not least, their wine list was awesome. Highly recommend. Will definitely go back when we‚Äôre in town."
90,We stumbled upon this restaurant walking in Soho and this was the best Italian meal I have had in Manhattan. My seafood pasta was wonderful. The desserts homemade and just a fantastic meal. The restaurants directly surrounding this one were begging us to come in. I was worried that they were not busy. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table here. Now I know why.
91,"Excellent service! Excellent wine, excellent pasta!! It was so Delicious!! We will come back for sure! An incontournable!"
92,"Dissappointed, my meal wasn't hot and I had to send it back. My husband's meal was bland and dry, nothing like the previous time The rest of the family weren't impressed either....just no care went into preparation and/or they are just reheating cooked food. Sad they have gone downhill, won't be going back. Too many other great places to try."
93,"I am really picky when it comes to Italian food. This place is really good, cozy, friendly staff, and very good food. We had Maccheroni alla Norma and Bucatini cacio e pepe con tartufo nero. Can't wait to visit again."
94,Piccola Cucina my top choice for Italian in NYC. I am a local and it is absolutely my go-to. The pasta is the best you can get (imo) and tastes like it was literally made in Italy. Every time. The staff is all absolutely lovely too as well as the ambience. Highly recommend!!!!!
95,"Piccola Cucina is my go to restaurant whenever i'm in NYC. The food is delicious, the staff is great and never looses its authenticity. Also a great place to go on a cute date!"
96,"I visited this restaurant for dinner with a friend and we had a lovely experience. The food was delicious, the waiters friendly, and the ambience and decor perfectly complemented the evening. Expect to discover the essence of Sicilia in the heart of New York. Would definitely visit again when I come back to the city."
97,"Was very excited to get into this highly rated restaurant. The food is definitely worth the visit. We had a Greek salad, cacio e pepe and lasagna. So filling and delicious. Only complaint would be the music was very loud and gave a nightclub vibe not a restaurant. Server was also fantastic and will return."
98,Went here when visiting NYC with my mum. We had a fantastic meal! We shared bruschetta to start then each had lasagna. It was the most fantastic meal. The service was also absolutely delightful. I couldn't recommend this place enough but make sure you book!!
99,A perfectly NY tiny and tight Italian - fish forward restaurant. A little outdoor space gave a few extra tables. Almost impossible to get a reservation but keep trying it is worth it. Extensive pasta selection. A tad hard to find low cal - low carb options but it‚Äôs ok to splurge
100,"This is one of the best meals I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life! And we‚Äôve eaten all over the world. I had the lasagna which was different than any lasagna I have ever had before, but it was so divine I almost cried when it was all gone. My husband had the Bucatini Cacio e pepe. They cook the bucatini (thicker than spaghetti) and then put the cooked pasta in a massive block of cacio cheese until the pasta melts cheese onto the noodles. Then they scoop out the pasta and melted cheese and put fresh cracked pepper on it. The entire restaurant stopped and watched while it was happening because it was absolutely fascinating. I absolutely will eat here every time we come back to New York! It is a small quaint place with a chef straight from Sicily Italy."
101,"Trip Advisor recommendation. Fabulous authentic Italian, great vibrant atmosphere, very popular. Small so I would recommend booking in advance. Great service, friendly staff. Food was excellent."
102,"Wow! I would give this six stars if I could. Nice quaint Italian restaurant in the SOHO district. The bruschetta was the best I‚Äôve had since dining in Italy 11 years ago. I had the Bucatini pasta with the cacio cheese and pepper. They brought out a giant block of cheese to the table then proceeded to melt the cheese with the pasta, then added the black pepper. It was delicious! My wife had the lasagna and it was hands down the best lasagna I‚Äôve ever tasted. Not sure how anyone could give this restaurant anything but five stars- it was amazing!!!"
103,"Small scale and fairly intimate. Great food, great interior, great service and a great atmosphere. Busy, so reserve if you can or go early like we did. We would readily return."
104,"What distinguishes this typical village-style restaurant from others? Their servers are all from Italy, maybe even from Sicily. This young team makes your stay a true experience, supported by above-average quality food."
105,"Yesterday ive been here with friends and I‚Äôve never experienced anything like that in NY‚Ä¶ food is exceptional we tried couple of different appetiser and a few different pastas.  Our server Marco made us feel at home by explaining the menu in details, and suggested specials we all loved. he did an extremely good job by taking care of us at all time even tho he was extremely busy, over all probably the best service we experienced in NY. Will come back 100%"
106,"Very good food and service !The ambient was very nice. I felt like I was in Italy, the food taste very Italian and fresh. Extremely recommend the lobster Soaguetti."
107,"Me and my friends came here after a long day of shopping. We didn‚Äôt have a reservation but they seated us right away! We ordered the bruchetta, Cacio e Pepe, and the tagliatelle. Everything was great! Our waiter Marco was super attentive and friendly. We will be back!"
108,"I went there in October during the week, service was great and the vibe was amazing.I ordered Calamarata with seabass and almonds it was delicious. All my friends were very happy with their order too. Will definitely go back!"
109,"I‚Äôm a frequent visitor and I absolutely love the place. The food is always fresh, the menu changes by the season to incorporate fresh seasonal vegetables/fruits and they have daily specials. All ingredients are exported from Italy. The servers are very attentive and make sure your glass is always full! If you are looking for real Italian dining experience this is THE place to go!!! Pictured are fusilli with langoustine scampi with Burrata and rigatoni with pesto and octopus for main course and salmon tartare cannoli as appetizer special. Absolutely all pastas on the menu are delicious, just pick one and you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!!"
110,"Great Italian atmosphere with very delicious food. You must try their eggplant appetizer, any pasta will be a winner and for desert, strongly recommend connolly."
111,"I have been always coming back to this place. Lovely atmosphere, absolutely delicious food and great wine! Thank you for all the staff, that is working hard to make your guests happy and a little addicted."
112,"It's been a long time coming that I write this review. I've been coming here about once/twice a month now and just can't get enough of the... well... EVERYTHING. The food is spectacular and reminds me of when I travelled to Sicily. The service? Impeccable - they make you feel like you're part of their family. And the atmosphere is warm and comfortable.  My girlfriend and I love starting the night with the octopus caprese and grilled calamari. As for mains, I'm obsessed with the Bucatini cacio e pepe. Overall, I highly recommend paying this place a visit over and over and over!"
113,"I am a big fan of this little cute restaurant. The pasta is just amazingly delicious plus service is impeccable. Prices are reasonable too. If you are looking to get some Italian dinner, it is a place to be."
114,Absolutely delicious food and a beautiful scene! Best authentic Italian food in the city! I love this spot.
115,My favorite Italian spot in NYC! The tagliatelle with wild boar is to die for and the service is warm and hospitable.
116,"I ordered the Lasagna della Mamma Rosa and it was so tasteful ü§§ü§§ The waiters and the chef are really nice and Marco gave us great menu suggestions! Thank you, Marco!"
117,"The food is spectacular! The best Italian food that I have ever ate in the US. Guile is a great chef! I had the arancini, melanzane a parmigiana and tagliatele con ragu. Other than that, the service is perfect! Marco was very kind and efficient! I highly recommend it and I will definitely come back to try all the other dishes! Thank you :)"
118,Great place and food! Really good service! A small part of Italy in NYC (; I totally recomend this restaurant!
119,"I love Italian food so I decided to try Piccola Cucina and it was a great experience! I love fish so this time I chose fish dishes and obviously Cannoli, but I‚Äôll come back for sure to try everything!! The staff is also very kind and friendly and the location very nice!"
120,"Super nice place at a beautiful neighborhood. I strongly recommend the lunch deal, amazing food for a prize difficult to beat in Manhattan!"
121,"Top food, top service, and fantastic price-quality/quantity with the lunch deal. I would strongly recommend It!"
122,"Super friendly staff, quick service even if the restaurant was packed, delicious and abundant food. Everything felt so authentic from the ambiance to each carefully-prepared dish. Two Italian expats who tend to be picky. This felt like being back home!"
123,"I went to have dinner in Piccola Cucina Estiatorio with my Italian friend on a Friday night the food was just amazing, we had Branzino and Fusilloni with scampi, the location is super cute and the stuff is kind and friendly! We‚Äôll come back for sure!"
124,Made a reservation to dine with a friend. As soon as we got there they sat us right away. Staff is very nice and friendly. Food and wine are great. Authentic Italian experience. Highly recommend! We'll come back for sure!!!
125,I was today in a very important meeting with my partners this restaurant is the best NEW YORK the richest food all Super spectacular and incredibly Piccla Cucina starsüíØüëç
126,The food was super good and th√© portion very big. Service is very good too as They help a lot to chose from th√© menu. Best italian in Soho.

128,Very authentic Italian food in the heart of Soho. The service and the treatment are probably the best I ever had in NY the food if incredibly tasty and the portion are very generous for NY standard. Will come back 100%
129,The most wonderful meal with even better service! I am Italian and approve of this authentic meal 100%!!! GO NOW!!
130,Had a fabulous dinner at Piccola Cucina Estatorio. Have been to Enoteca & Osteria as well. The staff is amazing and the food is out of the world. I get the cot octopus caprese and pasta with mushrooms every time. Always a wonderful experience when I come! Highly recommend!
131,Piccola Cucina was absolutely delicious! We have been waiting to try their delicious pasta for over a year and it did not disappoint! Request to be at Diego‚Äôs table - super fun! We will be back very soon!
132,Amazing experience with the most amazing staff.!! I had my bachelorette party here with all my friends and we had the most amazing service and the best food
133,"Fun, knowledgeable staff and my favorite cacio e pepe in the city. Everything is so fresh but so fast. It‚Äôs a slam dunk for a great, fun meal."
134,"First of all service from all the staff was extraordinary at all times. The food from antipasti to main course as always fabulous. Strongly recommend the prosciutto with burrata and the scampi fusilli, also the Italian beer was great!"
135,I have spent amazing time in there. Amazing food amazing service. I have had Chianti wine and cacio and pepe pasta. I've loved them. Super suggested
136,"As a Sicilian, I could feel the authenticity of this place as soon as I walked in. It‚Äôs so cozy and feels like home. The portion sizes are huge and the rice balls are the best I‚Äôve ever had! A+"
137,"Went there with a couple of friends last night, service was tremendously good and food was ridiculously amazing. We took few starters (octopus, riceballs, meatball) and than a main each my pasta with lobster was unbelievably tasty and portion are very generous. Would definitely put Piccola cucina estiatorio in my favorite spot list."
138,"Visited NY from Los Angeles earlier this month. On Oct 14, local friends took us here. We had a great time and loved everything about it. Then on our last night in NY, we had LA friends visiting so we took them. A special night. Misha the ma√Ætre d, recognized us from the prior week and was engaging, gracious, and looked after us very well. Food-spectacular; wine-had never had Sicilian wine and he directed us to a couple of bottles which we loved; service-impeccable! And, Marco did a good job, too! Highly recommended!!"
139,"We came here for our first night's dinner on a recent trip to NYC. While the food was good, the pasta was well cooked, and the service was adequate - there were just too many people crammed into this small restaurant. We sat a two-top right next to the large open window to the front patio, after sidling in between tightly crammed tables and encouraging the table next to us to remove their purses from our seats and hold them on their laps. The small space was made a bit more uncomfortable by having very large format menus. If the physical size of the menu is greater than the distance between tables - it makes things extra challenging. In addition, the poor staff had to try to get in and around the restaurant with essentially no extra space at the serving stations, making things rough to avoid a bit of jostling.  I'd prefer to come back on a quiet night (if there is such a thing) to avoid feeling so close to everyone."
140,"We came on a Tuesday night and there was a line up so make sure to make reservations! No cocktails available at this restaurant but we did order some beers to start. We were able to bring our own wine for a corkage fee. We shared the rice balls, wild boar meatballs and lobster/guac and burrata/mush bruschetta-all excellent! For our mains we ordered the lasagna(which my husband raved about), mussel/linguine special and the grilled branzino, which were wonderful! I asked the server if they could debone the fish for me, which he replied they could not. When the fish arrived, it had been deboned! So happy! My daughter‚Äôs Milanese chicken was really tasty but it was huge and could have easily fed two people. The desserts were yummy too. Because the restaurants is small and so busy, it felt a little rushed at times(and a tad on the hot side)but we understand the need to turn tables over. The service was very attentive despite the restaurant being packed. I highly recommend!"
141,"So ... the restaurant on Spring Street didn't bother to notify me they were closed. We ended up being routed to this sister restaurant. The menu item we wanted (pasta with sea urchin) was offered but in a different version. Good, but not what we wanted. No bread is served. Shocking! They have a lunch special menu that was not mentioned and I just happened to order it. Small serving, but tasty. Crowded with table spacing way too close. We've just started going back out again but the pandemic still points to spacing further apart. All in all -- too expensive and small portions. And not serving bread is disappointing. The freebie cannoli were delicious. But overall -- I won't return."
142,"Even my Sicilian-American parents would have been impressed with the food and wine. Our family gathering was served delicious appetizers of rice balls, crispy calamari and eggplant Parmesan among others. The homemade lamb, osso bucco raviolis were to die for. Dessert was an amazing cannoli consisting of a fresh, crunchy shell and sweet, creamy filling. The wait staff couldn't have been more accommodating and courteous despite how busy it was. Can't say enough about the experience. If I could give more than five stars, I would!"
143,"This place can not even get salad correct. All the food was terrible. The place is loud, waiting staffs also have loud voices to the point of nearly defeaning you. Expensive!"
144,Seafood pasta with shrimps and cheese was incredible. The antipasti of eggplant was tasty. Desserts were delicious. Ambience is nice and staff are very attentive and welcoming! Definitely a must visit if you are in town.
145,The food is delicious. I love Italian food and this was beyond my expectations. The calamari and octopus both very fresh and generous and the pasta to die for. Generous food and lovely setting. The outdoor space is very nice. I understand why it is so high in TripAdvisor ratings
146,"Delicious food and wonderful atmosphere! We sat outside and it was very nice. Everything we ate was delicious - burrata, arancini, octopus salad, seafood pasta, branzino (cooked perfectly!) and a side of vegetables (tasted just like Italy). Benedetta made an amazing Aperol Spritz and then when I ordered another, showed me how to make it (Grazie, Benedetta!). The cannoli are also excellent. The waiters are Italian and are very nice. As someone who lived in Italy extensively, I am picky about Italian food. Look forward to coming back for many more meals."
147,Thank you for the amazing dinner ! Everything taste GREAT and Italian . I have eaten the best of my life ! And the arancini was soooo YAMMY ! I‚Äôll be back as soon as possible for your fresh fish market! Thank you guys!
148,"Visited New York for business and a co-worker was pleading that we eat Italian...and I found this establishment via some exceptional reviews. This is a quaint restaurant, rather small, but large in character. Having toured Italy, I would characterize Piccola Cucina as extremely authentic. Our server was from Sicily, the server waiting the table next to us from Rome. The wine list was 100% Italian, the most extensive, comprehensive list of offerings that I have ever seen outside of Rome, Tuscany or the Amalfi Coast. Dinner was amazing. We both feasted on the Burrata con pomodorini e basilico and Ravioli stuffed with ricotta in a mixed mushroom sauce featuring sausage meatballs. The restaurant offers a solid selection of seafood options! I will note that the restaurant was packed and people never stopped trying to get in. Looks like reservations are a must for this charming, delicious eatery...that will for an hour or so make you feel as though you are on the Italian coast. Highly, highly recommend!"
149,One of our favorite places in New York. Always delicious. Always busy. Always friendly. this night was great as usual. The Gamberi Caprese - very interesting. Bucatini Cachio Pepe - sublime. Spaghetti Neri Lobster - a feast for the palate and the eyes. The Verdure Grigliate and Patae Limone rounded out the fare. looking forward to out next adventure at Piccola Cucina.
150,"We reserved at the last minute via 'open table' and when we arrived we were seated fairly quickly. The service was good for this very small and crowded restaurant, and very noisy. As for the food, it seems that Sicilian cooking can be tailored for American tastes : in other words taking the tastes out of most of the tasty ingredients starting with the complimentary sun-dried tomato and caper pur√©e. The sea food pasta plates were over salted and bathed in sauce as if to compensate the lack of taste from the starters and making tasting the pasta impossible. In general the place lacks subtlety."
151,"Everything is good. The food, the ambiance, the service and the location. The burrata and the octopus are specially good."
152,"Food amazing, staff superb and atmosphere the best. Restaurant small but creates a unique experience."
153,You‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre in Italy! Treat yourself to dinner here the food is delicious! Reasonable prices too!
154,"We visited this little Italian gem on Christmas Eve. Great food and service. We had ravioli, truffles pasta and pasta with lobster. All great dishes accompanied with very nice Italian wine made our evening perfect. Also, the atmosphere and interior is great. If you like an Italian experience in NYC this is the place to go!"
155,Tiny but wonderful Italian restaurant with homemade pasta and great energy. The staff was so kind and enjoyable
156,"Piccola Cucina Estiatorio is perhaps New York‚Äôs most dedicated to the culinary spirit of Sicilian cuisine, now that Eolo in Chelsea has been closed down. I loved the Paccheri alla Carbonara, and the coffee with cannoli was a great cap on the night."
157,We tumbled across the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon during our NY holiday and absolutely fell in love with the place. We were lucky to get a table without booking as the restaurant got quite busy shortly after. The food was very fresh and absolutely delicious and all the waiters extremely attentive. At least half of the guests were from Italy which is always a good sign to find authentic Italian cuisine. We came back on our last evening because we enjoyed it so much - highly recommend!
158,"The Hostess was so nice to find us a table, even though we didn't have a reservation (and from what we saw, the place was very busy). The attention was great, and the food was DE-LI-CIOUS. We're both from Per√∫, which is THE destination to eat delicious food at fair prices, and we both agreed that Piccola Cucina could EASILY compete with any of the top restaurants back home, the prices were more than fair, and the food was amazing; will recommend to any friends/family coming to NYC."
159,So many young Italian speakers in this restaurant. All friends and all having so much fun. Food and vibe were incredible and authentic.
160,"Scrumptious pasta dishes with a focus on seafood and super friendly service make this place a great choice for dinner in the Village. Our sever was attentive and friendly. The environment was small and intimate and, though tables are close, the lively atmosphere made for a friendly room with a great vibe. We had a really good time and would easily recommend it both for the food and the experience. They have a full compliment of beer and wine, but no liquor license for cocktails, which I mention only because a good nigroni would fit the great food. Go and enjoy, this place hit the spot!!!"
161,Nice small cozy place. Tucked away in soho. Busy vibe loud ambience and great food. The staff is overly friendly & welcoming a bonus in my book.
162,Had pasta cacio pepe and a slice of pasticcio Just fantastic. And the final coffee woth sicilian cannoli was a dream come true
163,"It was a busy Sunday night, but I was able to get a table in the corner. This restaurant is one of 3 within a few blocks of each other. All Piccola Cucina, each with a different ending. I ordered cavetelli with meat sauce and wild fennel. Interestingly, it was served in the pan in which it was cooked. Large portion; adding grated cheese made it even tastier. I could barely finish it. At $18, it was reasonably priced A Peroni beer was the appropriate drink. With the front opened, it's like outside seating."
164,"You know it‚Äôs a good start when everyone in the restaurant is from Sicily, from waiters to cooks! The food is fresh and clearly lovingly prepared, and you just feel good eating it and after you‚Äôve eaten it. It‚Äôs a place you want to hang out out and come back to. Top-notch! So hi to Carmello!"
165,"We visited on a very rainy night in NYC, but totally worth it!! Started with the Grilled Sardines and Octopus which were perfectly done. Main courses were Pasta Norma (a Sicilian traditional dish) and Pasta Fruti di Mar. The pasta was perfectly cooked and sauce beautiful. We have been to Sicily twice and this restaurant's food reminded us of those trips. The place is a little noisy, but creates the warm atmosphere for this great Italian Food. We will be back!!"
166,"After reading the reviews I had high expectations. The wine recommendations were excellent but the waiter was a bit pushy recommending too much food! We had a seafood/veggie combo appetizer and the Sicilian rice balls. Be prepared for fish and shrimp complete with heads and eyes. My sister did not like her grilled seafood plate, it looked a little too fresh from the sea. The pastas were good but a bit too al dente. Super loud once it fills up, can't really have a conversation. Next time I'll try somewhere else. Cute little place and Spring Street is a fun area for strolling."
167,Amazing food and great wines. A lovely Sicilian corner. A special thanks to Emanuele that helped us with our choice and a perfect wine pairing.
168,"My partner recently had a big birthday and we celebrated it by visiting New York, with friends flying in from Paris, France; California and Dallas, Texas to celebrate it with us - so it was really important I got the restaurant for the birthday dinner right. I chose the Piccola Cucina Estiatorio because of the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. The restaurant fully lived up to them. The food was delicious, the service was amazing and the atmosphere was fantastic. I can't recommend this place highly enough if you want a place with great food, great service and a great atmosphere. It was perfect for my partner who likes good food and service but can't stand the pretension of overly-posh restaurants. We were a party of nine and were looked after brilliantly, from the helpful person who took my call to book the table (thank you Maria) to the wonderful staff in the restaurant who made us feel so welcome. Thank you all for making it a fantastic evening which we will remember fondly for a long time."
169,"I thought I‚Äôd had the best pasta in Italy but Piccolo Cucina managed to beat all expectations!  We had 3 pastas: the tagliatelle with octopus ragu, the meat ragu, and Bucatini cacio e pepe.  The tagliatelle with octopus ragu was a complete showstopper! The other two dishes were also delicious.  The service was perfect, and the ambiance was good - relaxed and casual but it still felt special.  I can‚Äôt wait for my next trip to New York just so I can come back here!"
170,"Following friend suggestion we had dinner in this amazing place. After several days of junk food all around US we completely recharged our batteries with delicious Italian plates. The place is small but very nice and the waiters very kind. Pasta was delicious, very well cooked and the meet and sword fish were top quality. Strongly suggested to whom looking for very good Italian food and trendy place."
171,"Good selections in the menu Nice atmosphere Super kitchen and delicious Warm and quick service Tables are very close Guests age 25-45, relatively young atmosphere"
172,"The best Pasta alla Norma I have ever had in my life! I'm from Sicily, living in NY now, I'm very picky with food... and I'm in love with Piccola Cucina Estiatorio. Emanuele and all the team are great, very professional and always with a warm smile that makes you feel at home. Sicilian wine list with some gems (drink local, always) the food is amazing, fresh, tasty, perfectly cooked and also the Tiramis√π and Cannoli alla ricotta as a dessert are perfect to complete your ""Italian escape"" in NYC. Can't wait to go back! ps: Team, the phrase on the wall ""cucinare √® un atto d'amore"" is not from Carlo Cracco but its from ""Enzo Bianchi"" from the beautiful book ""il pane di ieri"". Ciao!"
173,"We ate here on a Thursday night at opening (5:30). Nice and quiet for the first half hour until the restaurant got more crowded. Host did a great job spacing customers apart as much as possible until it got busier. Service was fantastic and very attentive without hovering. Each course was served promptly but did not feel rushed. Burrata cheese with cherry tomato and arugula appetizer was the freshest cheese I've had a restaurant - seasoned perfectly with lovely presentation. I had the squid ink spaghetti with scampi langoustine and squash blossoms - the pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly with a velvety smooth and rich sauce. Definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had! Dessert was very good - cannoli had perfectly crisp and flavorful shells with a delectable filling. The custard in the tiramisu and creme brulee was smooth, rich, and flavorful. I would highly recommend this restaurant - try to come early because it is cramped and when it fills up, you have no elbow room. Cost is a bit pricey, but not bad for quality of food and service and location!!"
174,"This is rated in the top 50 NYC restaurants. It‚Äôs good but is it in the top 50? The place is tiny so tables are very close together. This leaves little room for the staff to get by, which can be unnerving as hot pans are coming right at you. The noise level might exceed safe levels so don‚Äôt plan on a romantic conversation. The food is good but you won‚Äôt be blown away. The lobster and pasta was okay but the half lobster tail was dry and just sitting on top of the pasta. The service is fine and fun topped by asking our waitress for the dessert menu to which she responded, ‚ÄúThe dessert menu is me!‚Äù"
175,"Visited this restaurant for our last night in NYC (it was a Monday) having read the reviews and expecting the very best Italian food.  Can‚Äôt help feeling a bit disappointed with our experience to be perfectly honest because it really didn‚Äôt live up to the reviews and I think maybe we were really unlucky.  We had made a reservation and when we turned up at the restaurant there was a couple just in front of us who had arrived without a reservation. Without asking us first, the guy on the door showed them straight to a table and when he then came back to welcome us, we then had to wait for about 10 minutes while he found a table (clearly he hadn‚Äôt checked the reservations before seating the other couple and/or had given our table away).  No apology, pretty inattentive service - having experienced amazing customer service in NYC, this guy definitely wasn‚Äôt someone I‚Äôd have put in charge of arrivals!  When we were seated, there was barely any room at the tiny tables. The restaurant was very busy so consequently it was incredibly noisy and while I know this contributes to atmosphere, it was impossible to have a quiet conversation (not least because the other tables were so so close!).  Food was good, but honestly I wasn‚Äôt blown away - I‚Äôve definitely had better Italian food elsewhere in NYC and in Glasgow and London.  We had the duetto bruschetta to start with burrata, porcini and truffle and guacamole and lobster. It was nice, although the truffle was overpowering and I personally am not particularly convinced by the pairing of guacamole and lobster.  Then we had the Bucantini cacio e pepe with truffle and a special ravioli dish with seafood sauce and mussels.  Cacio e Pepe is my all time favourite Italian dish. I‚Äôm afraid I wasn‚Äôt blown away by this one. The pasta was a little more than al dente and the truffle sauce overpowered the simple cacio e pepe sauce too much.  The ravioli was filled with spinach and ricotta accompanying a very rich seafood sauce, it was nice but again a little heavy.  We had a very nice bottle of Primitivo, that was probably the highlight.  Generally the service wasn‚Äôt great - probably because it was so busy, but still. Twice in the hour we were there birthdays were announced with music so loud it could burst your ear drums - a tradition I don‚Äôt mind so much because it‚Äôs nice to make a fuss of someone on their bday but the music went on for so long, long after people had lost interest!  I don‚Äôt like writing negative reviews because it is so difficult running and maintaining restaurants profitably and so all the positives should be celebrated. But this place is so highly rated I just wanted to provide some balance for travellers particularly because this wasn‚Äôt the outstanding quiet dinner I was expecting."
176,"This small, cozy, authentic Italian restaurant specialized in seafood is our favorite place to eat in NYC. It exceeded our expectations. They have a wonderful Italian wine selection and a wide food menu with seasonal ingredients. We had a Plateau Royal and a bottle of Dom Perignon 2009 Vintage Brut. The food was beautifully presented and well-cooked. Friendly and prompt service."
177,"We were so excited for our reservation and to see our big group of old friends. We were not disappointed. We sat at a long table and ordered endless food and drink. It was a small place that seemed very authentic. The bathroom was a small cozy room. The food was delicious. Everything. The waiter was super great. As the night went on and on, he pulled some of us who were dancers up to dance when a good song started! It was a hugely fun night."
178,"Very nice Italian (Sicilian) restaurant. Atmosphere is very nice and relaxing with music that goes up time to time. Service is very good and friendly. Excellent food, just portions a bit too big. Reasonable prices."
179,We dined at Piccola Cucina Estiatorio this evening. It was like walking into someone‚Äôs home. It was warm & welcoming. The staff were very attentive. The food was amazing. I Would highly recommend this restaurant. Five stars!
180,"Best service in town. Shoutout to my men, Carmelo, Jacomo, Costa and Emanuelle! Piccola Fridays would not be the same without you!! Thank you for always accomodating me and my guests."
181,"I was asked to out to dine at this restaurant with 6 Italian's (4 of them from New York) so I thought that it was always going to be a fabulous meal and a good evening and it totally lived up to those expectations. This restaurant, like the name suggests, is a small kitchen, (with the 4 chef's busy within, which you can see clearly from the dining area). Whilst small they cram in a lot of guests, which ordinarily if in any other restaurant you would probably think (""This is too cramped"") BUT at this restaurant it totally works and just adds to the amazing Italian party atmosphere that this place has, it really was fabulous and fun. The food was some of the best Italian I have ever eaten... The meatballs with mushroom and truffle to start was just divine and the ricotta ravioli with mushroom and pieces of sausage was also a dish that I didn't want to end. Prices are not too bad either with a feast of a dinner with a bottle of wine costing US$420 for 7 people. I finished sharing a traditional Sicilian dessert called a 'Cassata' with my friend (who is of Sicilian origins) and it was absolutely delicious... The perfect end to a perfect Italian evening in downtown Manhattan. I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant."
182,"Love, love, loved this restaurant! Small, cosy, authentic and full of atmosphere! Had a real buzz about it! The food was delicious, very generous portions, service was great, but the ambience really makes this place! I would definitely recommend it!"
183,"If you crave good Italian pasta, this is the place to go. Most of the dishes are focused on seafood. The Lobster and truffle pastas are my favorite. The cannolis are delicious. The seats are very tight but you are getting really amazing food for the price. Very friendly waiters and festive atmosphere."
184,"Great atmosphere, 100% authentic and passion through all staff. I would highly recommend this place to everyone! Grazie di cuore. ~Tony (dal Canada)"
185,It‚Äôs small and crowded but that‚Äôs what makes it even more special. The wait staff works like a seamless team taking care of all patrons nonstop. It is like sitting at a family table in Italy and everyone is happy you are there! Food was delicious
186,Best Italian food in nyc I love this place and the food is really really good we will come back soon
187,"This was a return visit and the anticipation was well-deserved. Every dish was a gastronomic experience to cherish. The Duetto Sandwich is hard to share but worth every morsel. Ravioli Funghi Salsiccia to die for. Cacio Pepe is a traditional Appulian dish done perfectly. Pachheri Seafood excellent. Patate Limoni and Verdure Grigliate great accompaniments. It is very noisy, but mostly from people talking and having a good time. Spontaneous dancing broke during our meal - just like dining in a local resto in southern Italy."
188,"One of the best Italian seafood restaurant in the area , the food is a really fantastic here , the taste of pasta is unbeatable and the fish is very fresh , so looking for a nice place to spend some good time and have an excellent sea food , this is your place"
189,If you love seafoodand and pasta this is the perfect place. They have 3 locations in manhattan and they are absolutely amazing.
190,nothing better for a birthday celebration then having a great meal...just delicious..........snapper cerviche.....grilled octopus......arancini (rice balls with meat inside). boccatini pasta with bolognese sauce and cannolis......where do i begin..??? cerviche light and fresh.....grilled octopus ..one of the best i have ever tasted and an ample serving ...arancini.. you could tell by looking at them how light they were and so flavorful....boccatini pasta cooked to perfection al dente style with a true bolognese sauce..and the best cannolis EVER....  a shout out to Andrea and his two associates who created culinary magic in their kitchen...bravo Andrea!!!!..... the place was packed and one can understand why...the food is so good.....service was also good..but the noise level might not be to everyone's liking.....so go with a group..or .if you like high energy or if as in my case you are celebrating a birthday which was recognized in the restaurant in grand style ...would definitely return.
191,Once again we tried the Cucina the night before and were excited to try this place because of the seafood dishes. The waiter was friendly and once again from Sicily. Refreshing to go to an ITalian restaurant with actual Italians working there. The wine recommendation was spot on for the meals we were having that night. The bread to start was amazing. The special that was lobster and bucatini I believe was great. The cavatelli dish I had with fennel was great.
192,"More space more music and more choices great decor, the team is always smiling and happy, waiters sometimes lose overview of the customers but the food is always fresh fresh fresh GF pasta is available and the Ape chilling display makes you smile. Pick any dish and you will enjoy it, authentic Sicilian flavor, priced well and good wine selection, Congratulations you found your SoHo restaurant experience"
193,"My NY cousins introduced my wife and I to this gem located in the Soho district. Just a small place open to the street, with a tiny kitchen. They specialize in Sicilian cuisine. All the cooks, servers etc.. were from Sicily. We shared a few appetizers; the best grilled calamari I‚Äôve ever had, arancini, buffalo mozzarella. We all ordered pasta , each dish freshly made to perfection. We also shared a few desserts, cannolis, cassata, pane cotta.. The atmosphere was awesome. Traditional Italian music playing, the waiters dancing with some of the guests. Everyone there just had an amazing time. We will definitely return on our next trip."
194,"This restaurant it will never finish to surprise me: simple, authentic, excellent!!! The seafood is super fresh, the atmosphere is great, staff friendly, genuine southern italian ( Sicily) food. Each time I come back here it s simply unique experience!!! Great job Phi & Friends Mari"
195,Omg! I have been searching high and low for Italian food in New York on par with the Italian food I had when I visited Naples last year. Let‚Äôs just say that the search is over! I have found the place :) I had looked up restaurants through trip advisor and was impressed by this restaurants amazing reviews so I decided to check it out with my girls. The food is just out of this world amazing! Everything from the pasta to seafood is super fresh and super tasty. For the table we ordered the stuffed squid and rice balls which were super amazing and left me and my girls wanting more! For my main dish I had the cavatelli pasta. Words can‚Äôt even describe! One of my girls also had the cavatelli which she absolutely loved as well. Other entrees ordered were the branzino and the spaghetti with lobster. Everything was perfection and me and my girls were satisfied. The atmosphere was also perfect. Clientele was fun and youthful. Decor was super cute too! Service was also amazing! Our waiter Emanuele was so sweet and knowledgeable! He made us feel right at home and even took my girlfriend out to dance! We all had an amazing time and had so much fun! I will most certainly coming back!
196,"This was such a find! Easy, fun, relaxed and good Sicilian food. The wine list is suitable to the price range and very good. The staff are friendly, the atmosphere a hoot and the food is really good. You will enjoy this. Make sure you book, it get every busy and it gets noisy. It's a fun and vibrant spot to eat."
197,"In my opinion, this authentic Sicilian-Italian place, along with its two sister establishments in Soho, offer the best Italian cuisine in NYC. The ingredients are fresh, expertly prepared, and absolutely delicious. The service is extremely friendly and efficient. Furthermore, the prices are very competitive given the supreme quality of the food served."
198,"We first went to their restaurant on Spring Street, which is very small & extremely noisy, so noisy we left and went around the corner to their, mainly, fish restaurant. I had the spagetti Nero with Langoustines and zucchini flowers. The sauce was lacking in flavour and was very peppery. They must have run out of zucchini flowers (already at 1:30pm) because there were none. My wife had the wild boar meatballs with porcini mushrooms and truffles. Both meals were okay, but not top notch Italian/Sicilian. They have very few Sicilian wines, and a lot of Tuscan / Piedmontese, which is probably understandable in the US. Sicily does have a lot of great wine producers so perhaps they aren't available here. They did have one Planeta rose, which is good, but for a popular choice Plumbago would be good. Work needs to be done in the kitchen & on the wine list, then perhaps they will live up to the name they created."
199,Never in US I found the same quality. Real real real Italian food. Cooked from real Italians. Family owned. Special friendship. I cannot find the correct words to say how I appreciate this restaurant and the guys that work there. SUPER!!!!!!!
200,"This is a small restaurant in a little group of similar and nearby small restaurants. When one was too crowded for our party of 7, they sent us around the corner where they could accommodate us. The service was friendly and they got us fed and out fairly quickly for a table-service place so we could make it to a show. We had salads, pastas and tartare dishes, and everyone enjoyed the meal. It's easy to find top notch Italian food in the city, and this was one among equals. Not necessarily a standout, but very good, Recommend."
201,Just amazing. We had such a.good time. Dinner was very delicious. We will come back. The octopus stater was great! The pasta Norma and the pasta bucatini was great too! The ceasar salad amazing and the lamb chops so delicious. The cassata for dessert was amazing!!!! Love this place! Service very good too!!!! Will come back soon
202,"The service at this small restaurant was excellent. Reservations are highly recommended, as the restaurant is small and, even on a mid-week evening, the place was full by 6:45pm. The atmosphere of the place is generally plain, on the dark side, but nice in its own way. My dinner consisted of three grilled prawns, which were fine but generally in the category of nothing special, and they came with lemon potatoes, which were quite odd to taste. My partner's meal consisted of mushroom ravioli, which he said was tasty, hearty, and earthy.  Potential diners here should note one thing: The chef seems to have a special affinity for all things squid, and nearly one-half of the menu items and/or specials included squid or squid ink in one form or another. ""Your average place"" with ""your average menu"" this is NOT. If you like basic food, finding good menu options will be challenging here; if you like eclectic dining, Piccola Cucina Estiatorio may work out well for you."
203,"This small restaurant, which has charming d√©cor, plays the music at a deafening noise level. You cannot hold a conversation in this restaurant. It is by far the loudest restaurant that we have encountered in NYC."
204,"The small venue on Thompson street was nice and cozy. I went on a date. It was loud, but they‚Äôre Italian so what do you expect. The menu was southern Italian. I‚Äôd order the grilled octopus and langostine squid ink pasta again. This is one of the few places that serves actual Italian food."
205,"Much like its sister restaurant around the corner, this place is also an authentic Sicilian restaurant. A bit bigger than its sister but still crowded with a happy atmosphere. A loud music played in the background and everybody are happy. The food is fresh and tasteful and prices are very reasonable. Service was excellent. As pescatarians, we had many food choices. A vegetarian can also find starters and mains he or she can have. Great place, highly recommended."
206,Great food and service. Front of restaurant open to street creating nice ambiance. Truly authentic food from Sicily seafood great. Small place so apparently owner had 3 similar small places in soho. We went to one on Thompson.
207,Business dinner with colleagues in Soho. Small space with great Sicilian food. Very nice Italian wine selections to pair. We loved the Arancini and grilled octopus apps. Pasta selections were fantastic!
208,Delicious Souther Italian Little spot in Soho... Food is delicious with the same flavor that you would get in Italy.. Pasta is al dente and the place bring you back to Italy with their music and amazing Italian Staff... Is not a turistic place is where locals go to have a great meal with friends and family. Is it quite popular so always full I suggest to make a reservation above all at night. Enjoy! Buon Appetito!
209,"The restaurant is very welcoming, staff very courteous and pleasant, to this restaurant always exudes an air of gaiety and celebration. The fish always fresh, wonderful dishes in appearance and in flavors. I really recommend everyone to try this restaurant at least once! A dish that I highly recommend is the ‚Äúduet of bruschetta with lobster, buttata and porcini mushrooms‚Äù. It‚Äôs very pleasant to find the restaurant with the real taste of Italy right here in NYC"
210,"Finding an authentic italian restaurant in NYC is not so easy (and no, Little Italy restaurants are not recommended), but Piccola Cucina is a real one. All the Chefs are directly from Sicily, the waiters are very nice and are helping you in having the best possible experience and atmosphere. They have different locations, this one is specialized in seafood, and it keeps up the expectations. The food is incredibly good and tasty; we have tried different seafood pastas, and all of them were great. Remember to leave some space for the dessert, sicilian cannolis is something you don't want to miss!"
211,"Amazing Italian food, fresh fish and great wine list. We recommend stuffed squid and lobster tagliolini. Great also the desserts. Staff is really friendly and prepared, a mention to Emanuele who made us spend a wonderful evening with his courtesy and sympathy!"
212,"On our last trip to NYC, we went to the Spring St location, so we tried this location. Delicious, too. We started with the grilled octopus--huge portion. We had 2 massive pasta dishes--raviolo and buccitini. Both fabulous, but we were unable to complete. Highly recommend."
213,The food was very good but not perfecto! Started out with the swordfish roll appetizer which unfortunately disappointed. The raisins and pignoli nuts were missing from the filling and it tasted dry. The grilled shrimp were fresh and delicious. Bread was outstanding but had to ask for it repeatedly before it was brought to us. Pasta dish was amazing and lamb chops very good. Servers need to try harder. This place can be exceptional. Like the casual vibe but music is too loud at times.
214,"This is part of an expanding chain (or at least a collection) of restaurants and despite that it's not half bad. Fresh seafood is the hallmark of this branch and it's fresh and well done (grilled sardines are a good test). There are actual Sicilians in the kitchen as well as front of house, and their senses of humor are in evidence singing along with Italian pop numbers at times (don't panic, it's not singing waiter stuff, just rowdy youngsters). One of the closer approximations to a genuine Italian eatery you'll find in this part of the world."
215,Nice atmosphere and great service. I am Italian and I finally found the best pasta in New York City! Salmon and porcini was amazing! See you soon Piccola Cucina!
216,We went here because it was across the street from our hotel.The Sixty Hotel. This place just blew us away it was so good the next day we went to their sister place around the courner... The food was the best Italian we have had in NYC..I think this is young crew and they are making an effort...love it..
217,"Great service and cheap price for the food quality. I had the bruschette with guac & lobster and burrata, porcini, truffle as appetizer, then the Bucatini cacio & pepe. Big portion and super delicious!"
218,"I recently had dinner at the new piccola cucina with some friends and everything was absolutely outstanding! As we shared a rich chef selection for appetizer, we tried the grilled octopus, swordfish rolls, grilled red prawns, a nice mix of raw fish and a fritto misto. It was just perfect!  The mix of grilled fish stakes and spaghetti with shrimp and scampi we shared for main was tasty and cooked properly.  Service was great and friendly, we all had a good time!"
