7,"Welcome to David Burke TavernDavid Burke Tavern is a modern American restaurant by award-winning Celebrity Chef @ChefDavidBurke. Situated on the first two stories of a stately townhouse on New York City’s Upper East Side, the restaurant showcases Burke’s…https://lnkd.in/ePAmTqE"
8,Get seated upstairs and ask for a cocktail menu and we are told they did not have one. Asked for a beer menu and got the same response. Service was slow and our appetizers came out right before our entrees. Burger was just okay and none of the other entrees were anything special. Seemed like a great place to get a drink but would not come back for a meal.
9,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at David Burke Tavern - I even enjoyed the oysters! I am picky about seafood, and the oysters were fantastic. In addition, we were there on a Tuesday, and they offer an amazing happy hour deal. The wine by the glass for happy hour that I choose was a Sancerre - very nice for the price! Not the usual mediocre white that I would expect for $7. I loved seeing the bar full and bustling! We enjoyed the sidewalk for dining - the street is fairly quiet on traffic - so eating al fresco was enjoyable."
10,vegans RUN ! unless you like what I had: roasted pepper soup : Luke warm and watery - they added a lot of oil for texture - Im not sure if that counts as texture - very watery and extremely small portion - maybe 1/4 cup total mostly oil - I was optimistic and said nothing - I ordered 4 side dishes - vegetables for entree - asparagus - sent back cold and unsalted - it returned undercooked and oily - Brussel sprouts - at least they where served hot - so salty burned my mouth - French fries - slight soggy and oily slight warm - roasted carrots - cold and undercooked - sent back returned burned - I offered to have the person that made MY BIRTHDAY DINNER come join us and eat what he made - and remade - the food for one of my 6 guest - never arrived and then arrived after we ate - that was her dumpling lobster appetizer then arrived and they gave her 2 extra - which was nice especially because her dinner - scallops so fishy sent back and returned missing the garnish she ate and also too fishy to eat - I won't even mention the others - people came in from out of town - we took hours to eat an unpleasant meal that took the spotlight of our gathering - the noise was so loud we couldn't even have a proper conversation - this has to be the worst place I have EVER eaten in nyc the manager took the bill and we just paid tip - HONESTLY -I JUST WANTED TO PAY AND HAVE A NICE DINNER - I wasn't looking for free food that upset my stomach - did I mention I drank a bottle of olive oil from those vegetables? CLOSE AND REOPEN WITH A NEW KITCHEN STAFF ! it is unfair to have customers come in to any establishment and perform like this - SOMEONE CALL DAVID ! HIS PLACE IS A MESS
11,"We had reservations at 8pm on a Saturday night. The place was bustling. The seating is very tight and the restaurant is loud, but a lot of places in New York are like that. Our server Sarah A was very friendly and attentive. We had the lobster dumplings, the short rib cavatelli, and filet. The brussel sprouts that came with the filet were heavenly! They have an extensive wine list. It is pricey, but we knew that. We loved the stuffed penguins that were placed around. Nice touch. Would go back next time we are in NYC to see a show."
12,"Have always been a fan of David Burke restaurants and his whimsical approach to his food and dishes to really create an experience. Recently went back to David Burke Tavern as it reopened and it did not disappoint. Great vibe, delicious food and the service was top notch. The GM, Nathan, came over multiple times to check in and ensure we were being well taken care of which was much appreciated.  The East 60's can be challenging to find good restaurants, so David Burke Tavern is a welcome addition."
13,"While the food and atmosphere are fabulous. We had requested a certain table which the manager Cristina who had said she would do everything she could to accommodate us. When we arrived we were told the table was reserved for another customer but we could sit at the table next to it. The table we requested remained empty the entire time we were there. When we asked Cristina she said the customer decided to eat at a different table and walked away. Her indifference was offending and appalling. There was no apology. As a long time fan of DB Tavern, I will never put myself or my family in situation where Cristina is in charge. In this pandemic era where restaurants are struggling, I will find a restaurant that is customer friendly and free of Cristina!"
14,"We came here on a park as it was close to our hotel and the original place we were supposed to go to was unavailable to us. We were so surprised. It’s fancy, but casual also. The food was incredible. The lobster dumplings sounded like something I would never want to try, but ended up being one of the best things I’ve ever tasted. This restaurant was definitely a highlight of our day in Ny. Highly Recommend !"
15,"What a wonderful experience. They were nice enough to get us in for dinner after our family graduation ran extremely late. Very artfully designed restaurant. Beautifully decorated. The maple bacon was hanging from a display with clothespins. My pork chop was topped with clams, the lamb was superb and my wife’s lobster salad was plenty as a meal. Service was excellent and they have a nice wine selection. Check put their menu on line. Great for home delivery."
16,"my party of 4 last night with overseas guests, Saturday, place absolutely full & noisy, seated in back room - excellent, polished waiter - appeared to be the only one for the entire room of may 30 diners, though. Frustrating. Seriously short-staffed. One demerit for that. Note to self : Avoid weekends."
17,"We initially went to the David Burke location that used to be in Bloomingdales off of 3rd Ave., but we found that they moved. We then googled David Burke and decided to go to the Burke Tavern. The menu was disappointing and we almost left but my husband and I split the grilled shrimp with pesto sauce and a grilled side of vegetables. It was really good food...the shrimp was maybe more like an appetizer? Although it was really good, we would have liked to have seen a menu similar to what they had off of 3rd Avenue. But the food was good..."
18,"I have not been back to the David Burke Tavern since I attended a party there and as it was restaurant week and the menu looked inviting we decided to have Sunday lunch. I started with yogurt with fresh fruit, a generous portion and a delicious dish. For my entrée I had the fried chicken, served with two poached eggs, on a waffle. An excellent choice, the fried chicken was perfectly prepared, the poached eggs were done exactly as I requested, and the waffle was delicious served with real maple syrup. I finished this lovely meal with some of their very good coffee. Our server Doug was most attentive and seemed to take care of all the tables on the ground floor. He was exceptionally pleasant which made our dining that much more enjoyable. This place has a great vibe, interesting people. I will definitely be back."
19,Go early and enjoy a drink at the bar so you can meet your neighbors. Just one of the friendliest spots in NYC. Food great. Service happy. Vibe energetic and upbeat.
20,"As a normal everyday New Yorker that is not rich, we wait for the semi annual Restaurant Week in NYC. This is when many FANCY HIGH END restaurants have special menus that give a very good sense of the full menu for a very discounted price. We chose David Burke this time around based on reviews and the menu. The special menu had such a great variety from surf to turf and greens to meats. ALL of our dishes were ICONIC, and we added a trio of small apps to share. The server was SO NICE and informative. We spent hours eating and chatting and never felt rushed, the support staff is very discreet and the service flowed so nicely. We ALL highly recommend a visit to this restaurant any time your are in NYC. We had drinks also and they were well made (full bar)."
21,"My wife and I decided to have dinner at this restaurant after seeing a performance at Lincoln Center. Though street parking was very limited, we found a parking g garage just a couple of blocks away which was conveniently located. Fortunately, we had made reservations as the restaurant filled up as the evening progressed. Even though we arrived a bit early, the staff warmly greeted us asp day we were seated right away.  The restaurant has a rustic, vintage tavern vibe with comfortable seating. The servers were friendly and accommodating throughout our meal. We started with the chef’s treat of savory cheese tart bites which were very tasty. I then had a delicious roll with butter that was delicious and a temptation to accept the offer of a second roll—-but I resisted!  For my appetizer, I went with 1/2 dozen of raw oysters which were outstanding. As someone who has had great fresh oysters all along the east coast as well as seaside communities all over the world I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these oysters. They were accompanied with cocktail sauce as well as an Asian dipping sauce both of which were very good. However, these oysters were delicious all on their own.  For my entree, I selected the roasted octopus and scallops which were accompanied by broccoli. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted even better than it looked. We ended our meal by sharing the hazelnut chocolate cake. It was rich, but not too sweet.  During the course of our meal fresh bottles of sparkling water (prepared on site) were provided. I never had to ask for a refill and the sparkling water was perfectly chilled. This was our first time dining at David Burke Tavern. I look forward to returning during future visits to Manhattan."
22,"Great location and decor. Quiet, unassuming place. Spectacular food and the service was excellent. Had help from hostess Janette in getting a gift card before making the reservation - worthwhile! Everything we had was great - this time was prime rib and the apple tart with ice cream. Their special bacon is expensive but worth the splurge! It is amazing and the presentation is a “Kodak” moment. You won’t be Disappointed."
23,"Very Good overall. Booked the place for Christmas Day dinner and was rather disappointed at first to be told the dishes I wanted from their festive menu were sold out, but the alternatives ordered were still very good. Service was excellent and staff were attentive and helpful. Good experience."
24,Great food . Went on Xmas day with family and everyone loved their food...service was excellent as well
25,"I have been here a couple of times thinking the service will get better than the food, nothing was more disappointing and embarrassing this evening to my client and I as we dined on the ground floor lounge area. The Asian server was so snobby, provided no customer service, seemed bothered, ignored us as she walked by until we waved at her. She forgot to place orders for items we requested and I overheard the same for the table next to us. I was extremely disappointed and could have spent my over $200 elsewhere for some appetizers and wine. Management, please find staff that can handle the evening lounge for paying customers, someone needs to be overlooking the staff and operations for a successful business. It's nice to occasionally check in and say to customers how is everything, as a manager to do this, I do and I am a VP Of Operations. You can be sure if I patronize this establishment in the future I will be looking at the service standards as I value where I spend my valuable time."
26,"Maybe it was because it was Sunday brunch and they had the C team in the kitchen but the food was awful. Cold fries returned to the kitchen. came back refried: everything was dry and tasteless or just plain bad. They couldn’t even manage a caesar salad - the lettuce was limp, the parmesan non-existent and the boiled egg nearly frozen. The place itself is tired, dowdy and depressing. Again, maybe a Sunday but if you want to feel 10 years older than you are, this is a good place to start. Even taking the wine off the bill - a gracious offer - couldn’t make up for the paucity of the experience and my acute embarrassment at having suggested the Tavern."
27,"Small portions, pricey, presentation and quality good, service good and decor ok. try it once to get it out of your system or off your bucket list. Overall it's ok but far from great. I'm still trying to figure out what the raves are for."
28,"We stopped in on a Saturday. We are in the minority that hates brunch but we were passing by and thought we'd give it a try (having been to other David Burke establishments). What a nice surprise for brunch people who aren't mad about cooked breakfast. The pretzel crab cake with poached egg and chipotle hollandaise is exceptional. The burrata with proscuitto and diced and dried apple was just delicious. The fried chicken and waffle was yum - damn close to brunch food, just better. The wine by the glass offers both a truly lovely selection and happy pour. We'd like to try them all based on the Sancerre and Cote du Rhone.  Hospitality and service are warm, good humored and helpful. We are looking forward to many lunches and dinners. FYI - Don't know how long they will do this but Sundays offer 50% off bottles of wine and $10 hamburgers. Crazytown. Not their usual ""thing"" (their menu is so well conceived and executed) but it's surely a good way to make lots of new friends.  Oh - you can eat at the very attractive bar which is always a quick week night plus."
29,"Got to attend a wine pairing dinner here, and was delighted with the food. I could eat the lobster dumplings every day for the rest of my life, and never tire of them. I'd request them as my last meal. They could have only served me lobster dumplings, and I would have walked away happy. I still day dream about these...and it was only offered up as a passed app. Also had an amazing quality piece of lamb here also...honestly it was all good, but MAN those lobster dumplings. The staff was also really nice and full of vibrant personality (which this neighborhood severely lacks in general)...this is the kind of place I would make a regular stop if the upper east side was a place I needed to be on a regular basis"
30,"The only thing that prevented me from rating a 5 star is due to the service being a little bit off, although they were extremely busy. We ate both lunch and dinner during restaurant week and were very impressed with the offerings. Highly recommend the lobster dumplings as well as the scallop and octopus entree. On Sunday's it is 50% off on bottled wines. Also recommend dining upstairs."
31,Nice bar. Needs a refresh from soiled and dirty carpet to basically the whole place. Our server was tooooo overbearing. No salt or pepper on table. Had to ask. Had a reservation for 3 and placed at a four top. Food was ok. Place missed its mark big time
32,"Walked here from the Hilton on 6th avenue, so glad we did. Excellent food, service, and cocktails. Very creative menu and presentations. Everything was outstanding the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. We had the clothesline bacon, oysters, and the best crab cake I ever had in my life! Entrees were amazing and cooked perfectly. I thought the menu prices were a good value for the quality of the food and service. This is a great neighborhood bar right around the corner from all the great spots in NYC."
33,One of my favorites. The bar menu is fantastic. Everything is beyond your expectations. Awesome wine list as well.
34,"Oysters, burgers, bacon, beers....in no particular order....on a happy hour and bar menu so you get the best of what Chef 's cooking up....quick. and when it is pouring rain outside, there is no better place to take refuge."
35,"We spent a month in North America, from Montreal to NYC, and we were forced to eat more burgers than we would have liked. Of all of them, the David Burke was the only one we’d have chosen for its own sake. Great service, great beer and excellent value. Only complaint was that our table was too close to our neighbour, forcing us to listen to an idiot from Nebraska. Can’t have everything, I suppose."
36,We flew in from Chicago for Mother’s Day and once I found out David Burke had a restaurant in NYC I had to make a reservation. We really enjoyed his Washington DC location. The staff were amazing and attentive. Our server was Shawn C. and he did a wonderful job of explaining the brunch menu and his history with David Burke. The food was delicious and made with fresh ingredients. I can’t wait to try another location. Well done!
37,"Happy Hour - good house wines, bar cocktails discounted. Burger is great with special fries if you wish ($10 and $6 respectively). Great oysters were a buck each. They were small but plumb and delicious. Regretted not just making a meal of oysters because the burger was too filling after. Bar at 5:30pm is not crazy and can watch some sports or news while having an early dinner. We go back regularly and sometimes David says hello. He's a good guy and a great chef! We always find the service just fine - Since it is Happy Hour, they don't press you with the check - you might have to ask but they respond quickly when you do."
38,"We went for lunch they had a special 3 entrees for $35. The best $35 I’ve spent. The food was very presentable and tasty. Everything looked appealing and delicious. Stop by with friends and family. Highly recommend it, stop by if you are in NYC. If you miss the special the food is well priced for the Waikato and quantity. Enjoy! The Rose wine and desserts were great!"
39,"Arrived late at Newark from California, long traffic jam getting into the city. It was closing time for most restaurants, and our stomachs were ready for a west coast time zone dinner. Called around the places near the hotel looking for a table, and was able to get a table in the bar at David Burke Tavern.  Very friendly service in the bar area. The dining room appeared to be upstairs.  It was late, so we had a cocktail and went direct to main dishes.I had the Filet and my partner ordered the Duck Duck Duck. The Duck Duck Duck was a better choice from a creative eating point of view. There was a duck dumpling, roast duck breast, and a bbq duck wing. I had the Filet Mignon medium rare, it was well cooked quality cut of beef, but it did not have the creative variety of Duck Duck Duck.  I would return for cocktails or for dinner if I was in the neighborhood."
40,Overall food was very good. The clothesline bacon was spectacular!! The service was the complete opposite. It started when we sat down and only got worse. Waiter approached and asked what we wanted for dinner. We said we would like to order drinks first. We had to ask if we could order appetizers as he never asked. He disappeared for awhile. Food came out and one steak was not as requested. The waiter blamed us in a confrontational way. The new steak came out after the 5 of us had finished our meals. I spoke to Mgr who said would take care of it and was very gracious. While waiting for the steak we ordered more wine and waiter came over 8 minutes later with 2 bottles in his hand and poured the wrong wine which we told him and he poured the other into the same glass. We said no you just mixed wines at which point he denied. We told him to replace the wine. He also brought another free glass to us asking us to make up a complaint so he could give us a free glass!!! This was also mentioned to mgr. From this point the mgr took over. For a restaurant of this caliber the service was well below par.
41,"The name of the restaurant has changed to David Burke’s Tavern but the location is the same. We had the tuna appetizer with avocado paste which was outstanding. The pork chop with garlic shrimp and clams still in the shell(!) garnished with large bacon bits and arugula was whimsical and delicious. The cheesecake lollipops dipped in chocolate were light and very tasty, especially with the bubble gum whipped cream brought as a side for dipping. We did not order the bacon on the clothes line which I believe is one of David’s signature appetizers. However when it was brought to tables around us, the aroma was enticing! Can’t wait to eat at David’s other restaurant in Manhattan, the Woodpecker!"
42,"We heard they had the Impossible Burger 2.0. We arrived before happy hour ended so had great burgers, Brussel sprouts, oysters and drinks at unbelievable prices. Definitely worth it."
43,"Lunch was a selection of David Burke's crazy, fun, exciting palette. Everything is a taste surprise, even the salad dressing.  Atmosphere is always happy and upbeat with good looking guests from all over. You can do a photo shoot of guests at any visit and you will find local big bold names and tourists and foodies.  And if you are free for happy hour....the treats are extremely well priced. Just say ""Tavern Burger please."""
44,"We spent a week in the city after Christmas. Tavern62 meal was the highlight of this visit’s dining. Having previously eating at Kitchen, I knew to expect a great meal, but honestly this meal exceeded that one. The oyster starter was fantastic and we loved the bacon flight and it’s presentation, but OMG THE PUMPKIN RAVIOLI. Honestly it’s one of the best things I have EVER eaten. I am not sure if this restaurant has a rotating menu, although I fear it does. If so, get that ravioli when you can. Seriously."
45,"Visited with a friend for a weekday lunch, and the place was quiet at noon when we walked in, but got steadily busier. Quite a decent selection if choices for started, main, and desert, and options for you to get 1, 2, or all 3 courses, which I always like. The lobster dumplings were good, although still slightly undercooked around where the dumpling was sealed to the lobster leg. The salmon main I has was cooked absolutely perfectly, especially for a thick piece of meat — it was very slightly seasoned and crispy on the ends, and a perfect warm butter on the inside. The presentation was top-notch, and overall, I thought it was good value for the money, as long as you are expecting an upscale quality meal, which it was."
46,"Clubby, genial atmosphere (upstairs), attentive service. Shared the gem and beet salad which was terrific and substantial. The scallop/octopus entree was tasty but for the price one would expect more than 3 average-sized scallops and a small piece of octopus, with a few stalks of broccoli. Guess this is not the entree to order if you want to leave satisfied."
47,"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. We happened upon it after walking around NYC to look at the holiday decorations and Rockefeller Center. It was about 9 pm and we were cold, sore and getting tired. We stopped in for drinks. As soon as we walked in, the warmth of the place washed over us. The decor is really beautiful, the room is warm and the service is fantastic. We had the best waitress ever.  As we were sipping hot toddies, we saw some of the dishes brought out to other tables. They were so artistic and lovely, I want to go back and eat there! The drinks were great and we decided to get a baked Alaska for dessert. They set it on fire and it was so fun! All of the servers were great, food and drinks were great, prices were reasonable for the area. Seriously one of the best places I've been to and it was at the perfect time for us. Also noticed that for happy hour they have $1 oysters. Highly recommended."
48,"I had hoped for a 5-star culinary experience from the beloved celeb chef David Burke but instead got a solid meal that failed to dazzle. The kitchen delivered a cold duck entree (they promptly replaced it with a hot one), a branzino with shriveled skin side up, and a strangely rounded salmon filet that (although perfectly cooked) lacked flavor. The star of the show was the stunning white burgundy Meursault Les Chevaliers 2015 priced at $100 which upstaged the food. It was worth every penny! I would recommend the place simply because of its gorgeous interior in a converted Upper East Side townhouse and exceptional wine list, and the culinary reputation of the affable Chef Burke."
49,"We found this place from a “google search”, looking for a restaurant for Thanksgiving Dinner. We were very happy with our choice to come here. Very nice atmosphere and the food was delicious."
50,We were recently here with a group of 6. I always enjoy group dining because I like to try everything when I am at a new place. We have eaten at David Burke Kitchen but this was our first time at the tavern. We were seated upstairs and the service was timely even though the place was packed. We started with several appetizers including the Bacon and The dumplings which were 2 of my favorites. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table which the waiter did try to up sell us to 2 right off the bat. Other than that he was efficient and friendly. I ended up sharing the salmon with curry lentles and it was delicious. The evening was fun and the whole vibe at the restaurant was lively and friendly. Of course we did end up with a couple of desserts to share as well and they did not disappoint.
51,"On my trip to NY we visited this restaurant tonight, my party had been before all raving about it! The food was good some said the main courses could have been hotter I d say just not picked up from the kitchen.....to say the least the service was deplorable, I ordered first they had no chicken left so I asked could I just have an appetitser the clothesline bacon and the dressed fries with bacon etc, no problem, well food took ages to come out, they had ordered 2 bacon for starter one came out, another waiter came and apologised they were cooking more it was a busy night, the waiter didn’t open the 2nd bottle of wine at the table or ask any of the party to taste a total no no, one of the ladies asked for water 3 times, starters were lovely when they arrived, reservation for 8, orders taken at 9 main course on table at almost 10 minus my fries he brought ordinary ones, just wasn’t listening. I was getting a train at 11 so missed dessert which looked amazing arriving at other tables....the main man was even in the restaurant.....all in all food excellent service shocking!"
52,"Whoa. We’ve been big fans of David Burke for years after visiting his steakhouses in Connecticut and Chicago. When we heard Gayle King rant about this place in one of the local NY papers we knew we had to go.  Just like the steakhouses, this place didn’t disappoint."
53,"Tavern 62 was recommended by the conceierge at The Michaelangelo Hotel. The food was excellent - started with lobster rolls to share, then had the short ribs also to share, both of which were delicious! For dessert we had the strawberry panna cotta and the waiter brought us their lollipops dessert complimentary. The decor in the restaurant was a combination of leather furniture with dark painted walls with a collection of books on the shelves and vintage pictures of different things you would recognize. All in all a very nice dinner in NYC."
54,"I had the short ribs and tuna tartare, and both were less than impressive. It might be because I was expecting more from a Burke restaurant. I usually more than enjoy his places, but this one missed the mark. The fish was a little gamey and the meat wasn’t rendered enough. Both seemed past their prime. The oysters were yummy, but even they had a hint of gamey aftertaste. Had this not been a Burke spot, they probably would have gotten a four, but I wasn’t happy. Don’t see myself going here again."
55,"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. From start to finish our group of 6 was at the restaurant for 3 hours and 20 minutes, despite the fact that we put in our orders for the appetizer, entre, and dessert at the start of the meal. The dessert did not come until after we had been sitting for 3 hours. Also, this was only a Monday night. We literally watched other tables fill, empty, fill again, and empty again while still not having been brought dessert. We were not asked for drink orders until after sitting for 30 + minutes. The waiter was mixing up which glasses had sparkling and still water and mixing them together. He also spilled beer on the table while pouring. I told the restaurant it was my mom’s birthday and asked if they could do something special with our desert order, and they said of course. Not surprisingly, they did absolutely nothing and did not acknowledge her birthday at all. The food was ok, but definitely not worth enduring their terrible service. STAY AWAY."
56,"Really enjoyed my dinner with a friend at Tavern 62. Very pleasant edining room on the 2nd floor of this old townhouse (nice looking bar and a few tables on the main floor). I feel like David Burke has, over the years, developed a modest number of signature dishes and does those very well. The restaurant is fairly pricey, but the Restaurant Week prix fixe menu ($42 for a 3 course dinner) is a good value. The appetizers we ordered were excellent, particularly the pretzel crusted crab cake and the steamed angry lobster dumplings. I also thought the bison short rib was perfectly done and very tasty."
57,"Downstairs is Happy Hour with $2 oysters that I’ll come back another time to try. We reserved upstairs fine dining and had a pleasant dining experience.  It started off with reasonable noise level and got quite noisy as the evening went on, but I found the atmosphere quite festive to have everyone chatting away enjoying themselves.  Came here for the first time sampling their Restaurant Week, recommended by a friend who is a regular here.  As recommended, I tried that famous Lobster Dumpling and it was savory while maintaining its juiciness, all wrapped in a Chinese dumpling like style with an unusual twist of protruding Lobster legs sticking out teasing us to consume it like a straw. As the top of wrap was fairly thick and not edible—the part where they did the twist, I skipped that part. But it lived up to its reputation; it was delightful appetizer.  My friend had the Bison Short Rib and loved every part of it. I sampled the grits and it was done just right. My original chicken entree, which is generally spot on—according to my friend, turned out quite dry. Understanding that chicken breast is suppose to be slightly less moist than dark meat, but overcooked kind of dry is not acceptable when it’s expensive and served at a reputable restaurant.  The restaurant was kind enough to switch my dish to the Bronzino and that was done with the right amount of grilling, leaving the fish succulent and tasty, enhancing the fish flavor to its fullest. I did however, choose to leave off the skin, finding it too chewy without the right amount of crisp needed to easily please the palette. It was served with artichoke heart.  Other than drinks, we ended the meal with the flaming Alaska Bake. What a nice way to end with a “crackling performance” where it flames up when lit, of course because of the liquor served above the pretty displayed dessert.  Overall, will definitely come back here even if it’s not Restaurant Week. But I’ll probably skip the chicken entree and try their scallop with squid when another patron seated next to our table raved about their entree, and recommended it to us."
58,My friend and I were greeted warmly by the hostess. We did not have to wait for our table and were immediately escorted upstairs . The downstairs was somewhat noisy so we were happy to eat in the upper level. Since it was restaurant week we ordered from the extensive menu. I ordered the pretzel crabmeat appetizer and my main entree was scallops and octopus. My friend ordered the salad with burrata and watermelon. Her main course was branzini. Our food was very tasty but portions were not large. I should note that we both filled up on the delicious bread before eating any of our courses. For dessert we had the famed lollipops. In the future I would not order these-much too sweet. The service was very good and very attentive. As the evening wore on more diners were on the second level and noise level was noticeably higher.
59,"We had the most enjoyable dining experience in New York City ever! A good friend of mine is a childhood friend of David's and we are so glad he recommended Tavern 62 by David Burke. The food was incredible, from appetizers to deserts. It was fun, imaginative and delicious! Our service staff were very personable and treated us like royalty. We have had good experiences and bad experiences in New York establishments, but I have to rate this one as the A#1, TOP of the Heap! Thank you David and staff!! We will be back!"
60,Everything was wonderful from the service to the unusual presentations to the exceptional service! Can’t wait to return!
61,"Went to dinner there Friday evening before going over to see My Fair Lady at the Lincoln Center. Our food was so delicious and imaginative! Our waiter was Anthony C, he did a great job and went above and beyond by calling Lyft for us to get us over to the Lincoln Center! I won't ever forget that❤"
62,Excellent location at Rockefeller center. The room is however very noisy. Good choice of mezze and fresh seafoods served pretty quickly. Enjoy.
63,"Had the pleasure of dining here- it was a moderately sized group- to start, the passed hor d’ouerves were outstanding... then apparently David had been asked with short notice to provide our group with a cooking demonstration- he was wonderful- engaging, funny, so talented and fun to talk to- made salmon tartare, oysters Rockefeller and made it seem so easy to make and sampling them, they were delicious!!!  Then.... dinner....OMG! So outstanding.... the appetizers were uniquely fabulous in both presentation and taste.... our fave was the clotheslined maple bacon- you cannot miss this when you go!!!!  My husband and I both had the Kansas City Steak- we have never had such a delicious steak- I’d like to know how they did it- totally scrumptious and we both agreed the best we have ever had ( and we have had plenty!!)  The desserts were whimsical and delicious as well! The cheesecake pop trees were a great presentation and delicious as well!!! The caramel apple tart with cinnamon ice cream was fabulous...  The service was outstanding- for the size of our group , they did a great job and were so pleasant and informative!  I would highly recommend eating here- I don’t see how you could go wrong...."
64,"My wife, daughter and I treated ourselves to a fine dinner at Tavern62 on a Sunday evening. We were pleasantly surprised to find out it was 50% off any bottle of wine. Our server, Anthony, was excellent with his wine recommendation and also sharing with us his knowledge of the menu items. We started with the bacon as suggested by others and were equally impressed. The two ladies had the chicken dish, they loved the taste and the succulence of the meat. My short rib dish was equally outstanding. We would return in a heartbeat."
65,"Sometimes I dream about that bacon. David and team always delight. Whether it is a cold beer post work, a long chat with a bottle of wine or a fabulous sit down dinner...it’s always good.  Make a reservation so you won’t be disappointed or try for a walk-in table. And while there, look around. You never know who you might see."
66,"Food was excellent, definitely not a bargain restaurant but it was enjoyable and worth the money. Make sure you have a reservation otherwise there could be a wait. Service was friendly and efficient. Restaurant can be noisy, Second floor is an more enjoyab\le experience than the ground floor unless you just want to be by the bar"
67,We visited for restaurant week and order the bacon app and the lobster bisque. OMG - that bacon is TO DIE FOR! The bisque was also good with a light broth versus lots of cream. I got the chicken dish and I could not finish it. We boxed it up and I ate it for breakfast in the AM. It was that good. And the parm risotto was also amazing. My husband had the seafood pasta. He liked it but it was WAY too spicy for me. For dessert get the Cheese Cake Pops. David is a genius for inventing these. We also had to take 1/2 of these home and they were also eaten for breakfast! Our waiter was delightful and I can not wait to go back to this GEM! If you are dining alone this is also the perfect place as the bar area has nice tables and it is really lively in there.
68,Terrible service. The meal was good I think I forgot between waiting for courses. It wasn't all the server. The kitchen was at fault too. Never again!
69,"We have generally liked David Burke restaurants over the years and so when a friend suggested we meet up here for dinner we were enthused. And, as it turned out, we had a great meal in a cozy welcoming atmosphere!  I got there early and sat at the bar for a cocktail. Even though it was really cold outside I can't resist gin cocktails made with cucumber, mint and lime and the bartender made me a nice one. When the rest of our group arrived we were escorted upstairs to a dark, homey room. The restaurant is basically a townhouse and the rooms feel like rooms in a house. Our room had dark (charcoal?) walls with red placemats on wooden tables and a big sparkling mirror over the mantel.  The menu had a few items we've seen on other David Burke restaurants and were happy to see that the clothesline candied bacon was amongst the appetizers. It is exactly what it sounds like -- four thick-cut candied strips of bacon studded with black pepper, hanging from a little wire clothesline by small clothespins. Deelish. My entree of sea scallops and butternut ravioli was mild and surprisingly substantial -- really good. Our table shared some sides and my favs were the brussels sprouts (crispy) and the veggie and sausage fried rice. The baked Alaska, although not the best I've ever had, was still fun. Hubby asked the waiter for a non-alcoholic version of my cocktail and it was gladly made.  Service was very patient with us as one in our party was stuck in crazy traffic. Mostly attentive (once or twice we had to ask for water refills), our waiter contributed to the whole experience with a great attitude and careful knowledge of the menu and its ingredients, particularly where my husband's need to stay away from uncooked alcohol was concerned. The hostess/coat check woman was engaged and really nice, both at the beginning and end of our visit. (And we even caught a quick glimpse of David Burke himself towards the end of our meal!)  All in all I would be very happy to return for another dinner!"
70,"Went there with a few friends , one of them knows David Burke well. Waiting at the bar it took over 10 min to be asked what i would like. The same bad service continued when we were seated upstairs . The room is very nice. The service slow, the food below par. The bread arrived over toasted. The appetizers , crab-cake and tuna tartare decent but no taste. I ordered a steak medium rare and it arrived medium and cold. After returning it the new one arrived within 2 minutes warm but a horrible cut. The fries were over fried , the polenta tasteless. The vodka martinis half full. Overall a very expensive not to be repeated experience. And the worst the manager who knew my friend did not even have the professional courtesy to apologize. For sure will not return."
71,This was our first night in NYC and it was a great one. Our servers were so nice and I'm sorry I can't remember their names but they were so friendly and professional and knew their food and wine. We had a great booth with Salt blocks on the wall lit up which was a wonderful decor addition. After our great food experience we had a great dessert experience and they gave us a salt block to sign and put on the wall.
72,"Recently had dinner at Tavern 62 with a group of friends. The place looks like a private club, with a very cozy and intimate dining area upstairs. Greeted by a friendly waiter that set up the tone for relaxed but efficient service all through dinner. We tried several of David Burke's dishes including a fantastic salmon pastrami, the addictive candied bacon clothesline, and a stunning Prime Porterhouse aged for 40 days with Himalayan salt. For dessert we had the cheesecake lollipops with a bubblegum sauce, and a blueberry flamed baked Alaska that were the perfect way to end a delightful evening. The food at this place is top-notch, and the service is as well. Bravo Chef!"
73,"Admittedly, I️ should’ve read other reviews better. It’s not a place for kids. They let us order from this “bar” menu, which the waiter wouldn’t show us, but told us had burgers on it. The burgers came RAW, on untoasted English muffins. I️ am a rare meat orderer and I tell you, these burgers were NOT cooked. The waiter was very pompous and clearly put out that we were there with a 10 year old on a Friday night. $81 for three uncooked burgers, $17 for a glass of wine......not worth it."
74,"Our group had Sunday brunch here and were very satisfied. The dishes were different from the usual, and the restaurant offers a 3-course prix fixe for only US$ 35.  The interior is club-like, a bit dark, with many striking details.  Our server was warm and enthusiastic."
75,Just off the beaten path but still easy to find. Great food and service. Try the octopus and sausage appetizer for something different. Fish dishes very good also.
76,"Standout meal at this well-designed, clubby, intimate restaurant. Just loved the bacon clothesline which was whimsical and delicious. Four thick strips of pepper-studded, lightly sweet bacon hung from mini-clothespins on a mini clothesline. I saw a photo on Instagram and knew I must have it. Well it did not disappoint. I am a bacon-lover so we enjoyed our appetizer with a bacon infused margarita which was subtle and well made. Bacon heaven. Going into the remainder of the meal I was already happy but we sampled a bunch of other appetizer which were awesome as well. The pretzel-crusted crab cakes also were fun and full of salty deliciousness. I had octopus and chorizo skewers (perfect octopus, good spice on the chorizo), we also tried a delicious cauliflower three ways special (couscous, steak and puree). My dining partners had the Asian Pork and it was spectacular. All hail the pig! at this worthy spot."
77,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Amazing. I would imagine the point of restaurant week is to lure diners to your restaurant and make them regulars. Yet many give you measly meals or limited menus. Tavern 62’s restaurant week menu is THE REGULAR MENU. A couple of items have a small supplement. We began with oysters and the avocado, mango and shrimp (four large shrimp).I had the duck, duck, duck dish–breast, meatloaf and a dumpling. THE tenderest duck I've ever had. Husband the hake, also excellent, everything including service was tops. Minor complain–rock music that does not go with ambiance. We had a 6:00pm reservation so it was not full yet. Highly recommended.  Sent from my iPad"
78,"My friends and I were going to another place for brunch which turned out to be closed,we saw this place and decided to give it a try,the atmosphere is very fancy and comfortable ambience,the service was on point, we had no reservation and was not a problem at 12:30 pm on a Sunday, $32 pre fixe for brunch,appetizer,main and dessert was fabulous,beats salad, lobster scramble,lemon tart,we had a bottle of pinot from Oregon state and all divine. I would eat here in a heart beat. Thank you very much for a fabulous brunch."
79,"Vised here during NYC restaurant week with a large group. The restaurant was very busy but the service was attentive and consistent.  Was able to try a range of different dishes including the 'duck duck duck', the peking pork shank - both of which were excellent.  I would definitely recommend this place."
80,"Another great visit and we got lucky enough to get John again as our waiter. You can not go wrong here, best value in the city! A price fixe menu - three courses for $35 and add in unlimited mimosas, screwdrivers or bloody mary's for $15. The food was very good (except my burger was over cooked), but we had more than enough food and I did not leave hungry! If you don't want three courses....order a la carte.....Do not miss this place!"
81,"This is truly one of the finest dining experiences I've had anywhere in the world. Service was great, wine list was exceptional. The bacon on a clothesline was delectable , the pork shank was a 10 and the variety of desserts brought me back the next night. This a great neighborhood upscale restaurant that's affordable and uniquely different. We will definitely be back."
82,"We ate here during Restaurant week. The food and the service are outstanding. Everything was prepared really well, including crisp flavorful chicken and fish."
83,"I strolled across to Tavern62 as it was a neighbourhood restaurant. I selected the pretzel encrusted crab, the bronzino and a strawberry mess dessert. The bread was very sweet which I don't appreciate but the crab was delicious. The bronzino was good, well cooked without having lost structure or flavour. The strawberry cake mess (what was it really called?) was too much for me, but the sauterne I ordered with it was delicious. Overall it was a good eating experience though an expensive one."
84,"We had dinner here and enjoyed the upstairs atmosphere---understated, grays and black with red banquettes---and the unusual food presentations. We had the shrimp salad and lobster and shrimp calzone for appetizers. Entrees: Tavern burger and Peking Pork Shank. The calzone was delicious but too heavy for an appetizer. Salad was delightful. Burger was delicious and the pork was tasty but, again, too much to eat. Altogether, it was a fun dining experience. Service very good. Pricey."
85,"It was pure serendipity that we happened on Tavern 62 while looking for an upper east side, early lunch locale today. Located in a townhouse, the vibe is perfect from the inception with a warm greeting from the bartender as we walked through en route to the 2nd floor where the atmosphere is warm and clubby. Our waiter couldn't have been warmer or more soiicitous; he actually hugged my mother when we left.  The Food is adventurous and creative starting with the spicy tomato jam and a tiny onion tart, amuse Bouche. Not normally one to photograph my food, I did when my shrimp gazpacho arrived in a large white bowl with what looked like a small ship inside, over which the waiter poured the soup. My mother had a burger, not your average burger, mind you. This was steak that was aged 30-45 days, then ground to form a burger, topped with cheese. The whole dish was deconstructed with the roll topped with lettuce, tomato and onion placed next to the burger, side to side with a fabulous celery root cole slaw and some of the best fries that I have ever tasted.  As we left, the waiter introduced us to David Burke who was sitting at the bar with the chef from one of his other ventures, BLT Steak, one of which is in Washington, DC. To say that he is a character is an understatement! He had me photograph the Flintstone sized egg containing a lobster.  All in all, it was a delight, a destination to which I will most certainly take friends in the future!"
86,"I was really surprised since I visited one of David's Burke's other restaurants and I quite liked it (The Town House). We were seated practically on top each other and the service was quite poor-waiter had absolutely no personality. He didn't come around to ask us about the food or engage in any conversation-really surprising since it's a New York swanky type of place and they should have waiters who are more engaged with their customers! The roasted chicken was good and so was the cauliflower. We had the angry lobster which was quite average and overpriced. It even looked angry! The shrimp Mango and avocado was something I would get at a family restaurant. Again, over priced . Pass on the hard bread that they serve you-really bad. I was really unimpressed and wouldn't return. Save your money and try another up and coming place!"
87,"Many bacon dishes, like bacon on a clothesline. Creative presentations, but overpriced and very rich"
88,"On this beautiful Spring day my wife and I decided to treat ourselves by going out for lunch* (*1 and 1/2 blocks) It is gratifying that we live so close to this lovely, 2-story townhouse restaurant. We have experienced at least 7 different venues in this spot; last being David Burke's Fishtail which closed after a business dispute with Burke's former partners. In this incarnation everything works. The upstairs dining room has a Country club library feel; dark paneling, whimsical artwork and a duck press. But the food is dead-on comfort food that uses a modern palette of foods and flavors to enrich and amplify your dining experience. Many tastes familiar to fans of Burke appear in different guises; almost an homage for past glories; carried forward into a new and highly satisfactory dining experience. (Angry Lobster ravioli, poke, pretzel-crusted crab cake to name but a few.) At weekday lunch you can partake of a $29 3-course price fixe that is a definite bargain and if you get lucky (as we did today) they might be offering a 1/2 price on all drinks ""promotion."" Delicious food in a delightful oasis might be the best way to describe Tavern 62."
89,"This is David Burke's new upper east side establishment. It is set in a charming townhouse. Dark, tavern setting. First floor is casual with a long bar. First floor is a great place to eat, especially if dining alone. Second floor has tavern tables and banquette bench seating.  Went for dinner. Great appetizer selections. You must try the hanging candied bacon. It is hanging candied caramelized pork belly handing literally on a clothesline. Delicious. The warm octopus salad was excellent. The lobster dumpling was a puree dumpling. The red snapper paella was excellent. Large portion, not the usual dinky NYC portions.  Secret service was there protecting a senatorial VIP, so we were well protected too.  Service was excellent. Very attentive staff, but not intrusive.  Great location on the UES.  We met David Burke. He is extremely friendly. This is his primary restaurant, so he is present watching over his creation. He loves to talk about his creations. Wonderful guy."
90,"Super branzino and my guest had a wonderful fish special. The ambiance on the second floor is buzzy and although a little heavy on the testosterone, had a great evening. Varied menu and interesting combinations"
91,"I got invited to Tavern62 to celebrate a friends birthday. We were around 25 people and served drinks and appetizer type dishes. Pizza,Little hamburgers, fishcakes, as well as all the other things that were served were somewhat unique and really quite good. It was a fun place for a party. Everyone serving was quite attentive and very pleasant. I had a really nice Pinot Noir (from Oregon), some birthday cake, and a delicious cup of coffee to finish off the afternoon. I luckily found a parking space right across the street."
92,"Where do I start... the FOOD!! My wife had the sole on the daily special menu and she said it was the BEST she has ever eaten in her life. I had the Branzino and felt the same way. Simply amazing... Although David was not there the night we were, he's usually there apparently. His GM, Clement, was there in his stead and she made us feel like we were visiting her house. A true professional who understands how to make your experience special. Wow wow wow!! Go there and make your NYC visit as awesome as ours has been."
93,"Seated at a table on street level, underneath the waiters clomping back and forth ceaselessly the entire time. Waited over 90 minutes for entree to come at lunchtime. Food was rather mediocre. Nothing distinctive in the preparation or presentation. Fish cooked properly, but utterly bland. Dessert was heavy and flavorless. This was Restaurant Week, so perhaps everything was made too quickly or for ease, but I will not return, because they had a chance to demonstrate their art and it was feeble."
94,"Definitely the worst David Burke restaurant that I've experienced since his days at the Park Avenue Cafe. Terribly slow inefficient and impolite service, discomforting food, and an extremely noisy room sum up my experience."
95,Tavern62 by David Burke has become our new favorite restaurant. Brunch was delicious; the chicken and waffles and maple pepper bacon were beyond fabulous. The ambiance is welcoming and the staff are friendly. For dessert we heartily recommend the Boston Creme donuts and the cheesecake lollipop tree You will love them
96,"While I don't expect normal service for V-Day, this was incredible disappointing. Service was very poor - 20 mins to just order drinks once sat. We had to ask for our server several times just to place a drink order.  Food was spotty - good app but poor entrees. Short rib presentation was extremely fatty. Gnocchi for short rib tough and bacon left very undercooked (fatty). Duck ordered mid-rare served mid-well. duck dumpling was a joke - small, tough and lacking flavor. The duck meatloaf was delicious though.  I expected so much more from a David Burke restaurant."
97,"Restaurant Week lunch at Tavern 62, a David Burke Restaurant. A varied menu and every dish was excellent. Oysters for appetizer, I had a perfectly roasted Branzino and hubby had the bacon ravioli which I wish I had had because it was sublime. A pecan tart with ice cream for him and S’mores cake for me completed a superb lunch. However, what made it even better was the service. Attentive, personable, and knowledgeable. I believe his name was Patrick. Hubby wanted bread for his ravioli sauce (what can I tell you) and he came back with warm baguette. If I had a business, I would steal him from Mr. Burke. Restaurant week is supposed to be a sampler to get diners to experience a restaurant. Based on our lunch today, we will return."
98,"The meal starts off with these excellent corn muffins, that are miniature and do not look like your typical muffin. Such an exciting start to the meal.  I had a special - which was filet, cooked perfectly with very delicious french fries. For dessert I had an excellent pie/tart with cinnamon ice cream. That was truly excellent. The service was very attentive.  We were there for lunch at 1:30 and it was crowded and tended towards the noisy. By 2:00 it was much quieter.  The downstairs bar is very inviting. I would definitely go sit at the bar and eat, if I had the occasion to do so."
99,"The service was not welcoming and the food underwhelming. Lower dining area is dark and have odd seating. The appetizer (seafood chowder) was good, but the main dish (ravioli) tasted as frozen pasta... Desert (pecan pie) was very good. Overall, it was not exciting at all!"
100,"I stopped in for a late lunch with my family and we had a great experience. Service was warm, attentive and knowledgeable.The Tea Time menu is served between lunch and dinner service and the selections were very tasty. The crispy pork rinds with Cilantro, Ricotta/Sausage flatbread and A perfect med-rare burger were our favorites. The Cheesecake lollipop tree dessert was also fantastic and a very cool end to the meal!"
101,The restaurant has a great feel from the moment you enter. The decor is upscale and fun with elements you seem to discover a little at a time. The menu is imaginative and offers plenty of reasons for more than one visit.
102,"We recently had a wonderful meal at this fantastic new restaurant at Lexington And 62nd. The interior has a comfortable den like feeling. The staff was attentive and knowledgable and always friendly. The food was beyond delicious! The mushroom focaccia, the lamb carbonara & the tuna were some of the highlighted dishes we enjoyed!  Looking forward to this restaurant becoming a neighborhood favorite!"
103,"Classics on steroids...creative beyond imagination...every morsel insanely delicious...fabulous staff...and, of course, our favorite most fun chef David!"
104,Things you need to know. On arrival there is a Humpty Dumpty and a very dead orchid in the window. Not a great start. Also there is no restaurant grade - not even a pending.......... The downstairs bar and seating area was very cold and the dark striped carpet up to the dining rooms needed a good vacuum - it was filthy. For me all the above is relevant and needs addressing - not what you expect of a restaurant of this calibre. My beet and gem salad appetiser was ok - not great. There are many better offerings in other restaurants. The salmon main was good. The chocolate peanut raspberry dessert delicious. They had run out of BOTH camomile and mint tea - seriously! Go buy a couple of boxes at the local supermarket. Sorry - needs work. Decor by the way is like a re run of the Polo Lounge but with windows.
105,Been there 3 times since it opened. Loved it each time. This is a restaurant for everybody. I go in there and there is a thorough mix of suites and casual dress. The menu selections can be incredibly affordable by NYC standards and if you want to run up a bill you can do that too. There is an attractive and often used bar on the lower level with tables to eat at and there are 2 fancy dinning rooms on the second level. The food is great and presented in style. I like the well hung bacon and angry scrambled. The help has been well poached from many of the good restaurants in the city and do a great job. My favorite is the lead bar tender Eddy formally from 21 Club.
106,"Great to see David doing his creative thing again. However, this time David remains super creative while bringing the menu down to a level of everyday dining. There's something for everyone on this menu and I'm quite sure many of these dishes are done with a grin on the face in the kitchen. Nice to have you back Chef Burke."
107,"Simply exquisite. My wife and I had dinner their Friday night and service and food surpassed our expectations. I had the veal tenderloin+ cheek with truffle special and my wife the Dover sole. We started with oysters, paella, clothesline bacon - everything blew us away. Chef Burke himself was walking around speaking with customers and taking selfies, we said hello and shook hands. He even sent us over some dessert - very gracious and generous man! Highly recommended! A+!"
108,"Great from arrival, honored reservations on time, and sat the four of us at s nice table.  We shared two appetizers and had 3 entrees and appetizer for dinner, all were great. ( pork and chicken were outstanding. All 4 of us shared the apple tart and it was delicious  We will definitely come back"
109,"David Burke is back..........in full glory. If you love classic David Burke, you'll love Tavern62 which is where Fishtail used to be.......and it's comfortable and it's a beautiful neighborhood restaurant with extraordinary and playful foods......especially desserts.  I had two appetizers..........angry lobster scramble (yum) and then salmon pastrami (yum again).  For dessert, the 5 us us ordered 3 things which was way more than enough. Best of the bunch was the banana cream pie."
110,I was solo and decided to try the newest David Burke restaurant....always a fan. I sat in the bar and had a wonderful time. Christina was an amazing server and made a couple of recommendations. They were perfect! Exceeded my expectations. Great job David Burke....who came by the table and said hi.
111,My husband had the Peking Pork Shank and Lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese with the French onion soup as an appetizer. I had the Tuna steak with the wild mushrooms and sausage side with the Caesar salad as an appetizer. The food was just delicious we highly recommend this place!!
112,"Decor is upscale but still has a relaxed feel, bar area downstairs with a dining room upstairs. Food is second to none; the bacon is amazing, octopus carpaccio fantastic and the king crab legs scampi is worth the trip itself. Excellent wine list, cocktail list and great service at the bar. Certainly a spot that we will visit again and again. Worth the trip from anywhere."
113,"Wow, this new restaurant is superb... the staff are so pleasant spoiling you from the moment you arrive right up until you leave! There is a nice bar area downstairs leading to the dining room upstairs which is extremely spacious yet cosy The task of choosing from the delicious menu was fun with the resulting food being absolutely delicious! The service was excellent in fact well above average as was the food. There was a comprehensive wine list to complete dining at this upmarket restaurant"
