0,Visited London Cabaret Club list night to watch the Christmas Gatsby Show. Truly spectacular performances and the most divine food & drink experience. Loved every minute of it.
1,"I went to London Cabaret Club for the second time last week and once again it blew me away! The show was fantastic, the food was incredible and the staff made the entire event seem like a party you didn't want to leave. It's an experience you have to try if you're in London or visiting! 10/10, can't wait to go back!  - Tahlia Coutinho"
2,"Excellent location, venue and entertainment. Just a pity that the food was not great which prevented the evening from being perfect. We were a party of 6. All 6 of us had the onion tart starter, 3 people had the turkey roulade main and 3 had the vegetarian sweet potato gnocchi, 3 had the chocolate torte & raspberry sorbet for dessert & 3 the fig & honey cake. Everyone concurred that the starter and chocolate torte were average, those that had the turkey main & fig & honey cake thought they were delicious and those that had the gnocchi thought it was awful and barely touched it so were left hungry. Such a shame that such events never manage to provide a tasty & filling vegetarian option because otherwise the event was fabulous."
3,"Last weekend, my husband had a birthday, so I wanted to celebrate with him somewhere where we've never been. So I looked around a bit and decided to go to the London Cabaret Club. Trust me, I couldn't have made a better choise, everything was better then I expected, from the venue itself, the amazing show, then the service and food and finally, the after show DJ party. This place is just a ""MUST SEE"" and I would highly recommend it to anyone, for any type of occasion. It was such a beautiful experience and we couldn't have enjoyed it more"
4,"We love our annual Christmas visit to The London Cabaret Club for my birthday weekend to London. From the moment you step inside the entrance door you feel a sense of magic. Staff are amazing and Sooo attentive, food was divine and the shows just keeps amazing us. Best night ever ❤️"
5,I was not sure what to expect but we had such a great time! Looked after well from start to finish. Amazing acts such a talented bunch. Thank you!
6,Had a great night. The show was excellent The staff were very friendly and attentive which really added to the evening. We would recommend a visit to anybody.
7,"Had a night out here as a couple, amazing show and music ,tables for two felt a bit squashed against the side wall but okay, waiters very attentive if you need a drink, unfortunately we were missed on the dessert course and got ours when everyone else had finished, didn’t like that they insist on taking and keeping your payment card until then end of the night, but the performers are amazing and very talented"
8,"Fantastic night, great show and food was good dancers were amazing great night out deffo recommend nice service too"
9,"We surprised a friend for her 40th and really had a great night! would 10000% recommend!  We arrived at the venue at 7.15pm which was perfect timing, we had a drink with some pre show entertainment and then were let in the room at about 8pm. The food was really nice and they cater for food intolerances too, which was great!  The show was sensational, the dancers, singers and acrobats were so good! Great vibes all around, definitely a memorable night.  We booked through Groupon so we were able to secure a nice offer but we all agreed the full price ticket would be worth it and we will be back for more :)"
10,This was an amazing evening. Wonderful food and the staff were very attentive. The show was spectacular! Outstanding cast. Really something for everyone. Highly recommend!!
11,"We had a meal as a group of 10 and the food and service was fantastic all evening, the staff couldn’t do enough for us. The food was beautiful and the entertainment was fantastic. Overall we had an amazing night and would thoroughly recommend to friends, Victoria was amazing all evening and went above and beyond to accommodate us."
12,"We paid for the more expensive ticket which got us a few extras. Service was good, lots of entertainment, even before show starts. The singers, dancers and acrobats were all great. Food was actually quite good. The atmosphere was also good ( been to something similar elsewhwere where everyone was talking over the acts and doing endless selfies) and everyone seemed to enjoy the show. Would go again."
13,"I'll be honest .. I do love this kind of shows.. but honestly I did not expect I will be so mesmerised.. the show ... hot , fun , sexy and literally brings you the shivers .. the singing the dancing the acrobatics left me speechless.. going to the service... from the front desk to our lively and lovely full of smile server Dean to the manager Nasos who really helped us with everything and went the extra mile.. I will 110 % recommend it for both show and service"
14,"This place is an absolute must for londoners or tourists alike! The ambience, the customer service, the food/cocktails and of course the performances were flawless. We went to a Halloween special and they had really gone to town in transforming the space. Thank you for a fantastic evening!"
15,"We came here with some friends for El Dia De Los Muertos. We had a golden ticket which means some pre-show entertainment and 3 course meal.  The pre-show started at 7pm and the entrance to the ballroom was at 7:30. We arrived close to 7:30 so unfortunately we had no pre-show and we couldn’t even get a drink at arrival at the bar. We were left standing outside the pre-show area and just seated after a few minutes into the ballroom.  Dinner was served at 7:45 and there was a bit of entertainment before the real show started. I personally didn’t enjoy it much. A bit flat, a bit boring.  Food at this point started to arrive. Food was ok. You want more bread? You have to pay for it. Some of my friends complained that the food was cold at arrival. I am dairy free and I had difficulties believing that they didn’t add some sauces that contain cream. I asked the person managing our table to double check.  To be honest, if I would go back, it wouldn’t be with food included, but just for the show.  The show was really good. Lots of singing, dancing and aerobic performances which I really enjoyed.  After the show there was a Dj playing really great songs, and we danced for a few hours. The downside of this unfortunately was that we had no were to dance. You either dance near your table, which means you will always have people passing by, or you move away from your table but again, you are in a very restricted area. Maybe they should move some tables, or allow people to go on the dance floor which part of it was restricted as the Dj was there.  In general I liked it because I was with friends, but there are many things that they should be improving if they want people to go back more than once.  General value: 7/10 Food value: 5/10 Performance value: 8.5/10"
16,"I booked the London Cabaret to celebrate my hen do with some dear friends This place is a dream. The show was ""The queen of roses"" absolutely breathtaking. The dancers and singers are so talented. I will definetely go back!  The food was also deliciuos. We had diamonds menu'!"
17,"We booked tickets 6 months prior for a West End Musical Brunch. As they only give you the venue a few days before, it's impossible to arrange transport until then. We had booked for their 5 November function which unfortunately coincided with a train strike. As the 3 November one was cancelled at short notice we hoped this one would too, but then it wasn't. We explained the situation to them and they don't give refunds (and you have to give 7 days notice for exchanges which we were not able to for the reasons stated above).  So, unless you live in London and don't have to be dependent on trains, be very wary of booking one of the West End Musical Brunch events tickets until the last minute.  Also, read the smallprint - the event is 5 hours, but you only get unlimited drinks for the first hour. The food choices are also very poor - either a vegan burger or a regular burger - very underwhelming and hardly a 'brunch'.  I will definitely not be booking with them ever again."
18,"This was by far the best highlight of our trip to London. My sister and I went to the Cabaret to celebrate a birthday, we booked the Royal Diamond Experience and it did not disappoint. The entertainment was phenomenal, from the singing to dancing and everything in between there wasn’t a moment where we lacked for entertainment.  The food was great quality and they even remembered our food allergy, taking special care with our requests.  We highly recommend the experience, something to do at least once in your life.  Thank you to the staff, you all did a spectacular job!"
19,"I have given 4 stars as the entertainment was excellent, the singers and dancers were thoroughly entertaining and talented. This is where it ends and I’d probably give the service 1/2 stars. I think unless you have money and are ordering the expensive champagne, you will probably be forgotten. The couple next to me had their champagne poured for them more than enough times through the night, but I couldn’t even get the correct drinks order or a drink without waiting a long time. The food was actually very good, but I would say it took too long to come out with starters after 8pm, mains around 9.30pm then dessert sometime after 10pm. Although we had been seated around 7.30pm. Drinks prices are very expensive, watch out if you are not saying ‘single’ measures of spirits.. they will just give and charge you for doubles, even if you didn’t ask for it.. which is £6.50 extra per drink. When queried the waiter said that we never asked for singles….. really? Such a shame that the service really really lets this place down, as it has potential be a great experience. Probably wouldn’t return & would spend my money elsewhere."
20,We went to the club for Halloween and had a fabulous time. The service for the food started of a bit slow but I could live with it as the entertainment was so good. All the acts were brilliant especially the singers. The food was ok and the drinks are on the extortionate side but for a special occasion I would highly recommend it.
21,"The show was absolutely amazing, the performers were top notch, multi talented. The acrobatics were also quite fantastic, they showed great strength done with so much ease, I was left speechless. It was a perfect birthday gift."
22,We had an amazing time here last night with our friends entertainment was amazing the food was lovely but a bit on the small side also drinks are very exspensive but overall was amazing experience and somewhere you need to visit
23,Great singers dancers and acrobatic acts. Real energy in a great location. Well done to all involved. Some very talented people performing here.
24,"Shocked by the 15% service charge applied to our bill, which was not highlighted at the time of booking the tickets or stated in the terms and conditions on the website. We were just verbally informed by the waitress of the service charge at the end of the evening! However, there was no service charge added when I came to see a show at this club last autumn. The price of the drinks + side menu was extortionate, even for a London venue, ie £4.00 for one very small bread roll + a portion of butter! Overall, the entertainment was good, but I think the show should have concentrated more on the supposed theme of British queens, which was of minimal content, and therefore disappointing in that regard. A very expensive night out, so unfortunately I won't be going again in a hurry."
25,Can’t express how much of an amazing evening we had. The show was bursting with talent and we were simply blown away.
26,"Absolutely Fantastic from start to finish. Venue, food, staff and entertainment were amazing, couldn’t fault a single thing and will be recommending to everyone. Please open up a place in Birmingham!"
27,My husband & I had the most amazing time here on Thursday night act’s/singer’s/dancer’s truly brilliant as we’re staff especially Evandro our waiter. If you get a chance please go wonderful experience.. 5*
28,"Queen of Roses show was a masterpiece, the deco, dancers and the show was non stop outstanding. Food was amazing , just incredible, chocolate, beef and crab was delicious Service great"
29,"Went with my three daughters to the Queen of Roses show. We couldn't fault a thing about our evening. From our three course meal which was delicious and the non stop entertainment, which ranged from singers ( boy can they belt a tune) ,dancers, to drummers to acrobatics and much much more. Yes drinks are not cheap but hey its the west end !! and considering you get a three course meal and a full on show its still value for money for a great night. Really don't understand the negative reviews.. Whole thing was truly amazing."
30,I don’t k ow were to start paid almost 200 for three people the food was a disaster raw lamb and I like rare meat blood all over the plate food stone cold and desert was liquid not set complained to the manager who has no customer service skills he was very rude .tickets being sold half price . Still waiting for the drinks we paid for Half bottle of champagne and beers missing .we think staff keeping drinks back for themselves .Disgraceful shame on you. Never even poured the wine Waiter service was a disgrace disinterested to busy posing . The show was just ok lots of gaps between acts and not that good singers weee good big dog appeared didn’t quite get that l intend to inform environmental health regarding the raw cold and uncooked food as these kitchens really require an inspection . We could not eat this meal as we would have been sick . Word of caution don’t waste money on this experience if we had the top package I hate to think what was on offer for others . Final point we were three people to be sat at 2 separate tables you couldn’t make this up what a poor show . Spend your money going to a professional theatre production and a restaurant that serves quality all in a if I could give zero stars I am still trying to find out who to make a complaint to as the manager would not help with this process horrible service horrible experience
31,First time in this palce. If it wouldn't have been for Viktorrja our experience would not haven been so beautiful. She is the best ever. Thank you!! Niko best dancer ever!! We will come back for you!!
32,Absolutely shambles with the food. Service was mediocre. I booked this for my wife's birthday and we never even received our desert! We made a formal complaint but was ignored several times despite chasing. Would never go there again.
33,"Had a brilliant time at the London Cabaret club for my 30th birthday. Performers were amazing and I thought the way they split the performances up with the parts of the meal interspersed throughout meant it felt like you were always well entertained. I would say the drinks were very expensive, £100 for a bottle of Prosecco! You can pre-order drinks to get 10% off but even so I’d say the drinks were very overpriced. Other than that though we had a brilliant time!"
34,"Cabarat was ok, although my partner and I felt there was no flow..too many breaks In between the acts.. Service was good, as one would expect, as you get charged for service. Bottle of House wine £40, service £6..  At the beginning of the show a large dog was brought on stage, Why ? A bit pointless!  Overall, we didn't really enjoy it, it lacked continuity, and felt breaks too long ."
35,Our waiter Jonathan was another level of amazing- what a credit to the team he was!!!! The performers were great and provided great entertainment for the evening! The staff were great which led to a fab evening. Jonathan thank you so much! My grannys 80th was superb!
36,"We went for a special birthday celebration. The staff were so welcoming and made the evening very special. Thank you to Jonathan, our server, who was very attentive and friendly. The cabaret was out of this world. The singers were super talented. Such a fun, lively atmosphere. We loved the DJ afterwards. Just a shame about the food. You could only choose between meat option or vegetarian. The starter was raw salmon, the main was tasty roast chicken and the dessert was some sort of strawberry puree. You will spend a lot on drinks but it is a a great night out for a special treat!"
37,"Did not get half of what was advertised, and food was terrible and extremely late. The whole package was bad really. We were sold a ticket with pre-show entertainment from 6:30pm. We sat in a corridor till 7:30pm whilst other people were taken into a room with a pre-show singer. The food was extremely late, cold, dry and had no flavour at all. The show was OK but had long periods with nothing going on so there was not really any atmosphere. The only good part was the strong man act. The singers had good voices as well. I do not think this is worth even half of what we paid. Overpriced throughout and underwhelming. I recommend avoiding completely."
38,"Some of the reviews on here, really put me off wanting to go to the London Cabaret Club the other week for a friends hen do but I am so pleased I went. What a great night out, the food was good, entertainment was great and mad, the staff could not have been more attentive if they tried and everyone had such a good time. Singing and dancing from beginning to the end - such a party atmosphere and great for a group of women celebrating a bride to be. I would definitely recommend this venue and would not hesitate to come again. Please don't be deterred by some of the reviews you read on here!"
39,"We had a party of 10 and all had pre order for drinks ,but on arrival we had to buy a drink as we couldnt have our pre ordered drinks until we sat down.(very expensive) the show was top dollar the singers were top class but our waiter for the night was so full of himself and a show off he wasnt concentrating on what he was doing during the ordering of our drinks so long story short he tryed to overcharge us £160 odd quid for drinks we didnt have as we all had pre order. we all stuck to what we orderd.we were detained after the event closed to sort this bill out we were getting surrounded by a lot of there staff which was a bit unnerving.we ended up paying half of what they were demanding we were going to get the police involved but it was getting late and the women were getting upset with what was happening.the manager was calm through the whole thing but our waiter was giving it because he messed up but wouldnt admit it,but apart from that the evening was great,,,but be carefull when it comes to the drinks.."
40,"I bought the Diamond package for myself, my mum and my sister, this was the first time we were together in 2.5yrs and we were very excited for the evening. The plus points were the service (apart from when ALL the servers had to dance around with sparklers because someone bought Dom Perignon), our server (I am so sorry we forgot your name but you were on table 1 on 1/04) was superb, she was absolutely lovely and as attentive as she could be with the tables she needed to cover. Drinks were served in a timely manner. The show itself, some parts were fabulous, others not so much but all in all, it kept us entertained.  I had bought the £125 tickets for us for the Diamond meal. We had to order in advance, which I had to do twice as I was told I hadn't done it the first time and on BOTH emails, I stated there should be no bell peppers in the Crab Salad (my mum hates them). Being cautious, I ordered the other available starter option and good job I did as there were finely chopped peppers throughout the Crab so we swapped. The canapes were 3 bits of goodness knows what and really not very nice and the bread on the table you could have cemented together to build a pretty sturdy structure, it was that hard. All the starters on the small side and mediocre, my sister opted for the veggie menu so between us, we tried every available dish. I had the lamb for main, it was hardly warm but overcooked, chewy and served with practically nothing but a smear of sweet potato or similar, my mum's fish was 'ok' and the cauliflower steak was a poor effort. Desert wasn't any better for me, my mousse was grainy, mum said her tart was ok and my sister said the torte was good but the champagne sorbet was a million miles away from that, I tasted it and can confirm.  So in short, the expectation paying £125 a ticket was great food and it was far from that. A private dining for 3 at The Ritz costs £120pp - granted we did have the show but also did pay over £250 on top for drinks and service, all in all the night cost around £600 for the 3 of us and it just wasn't worth it.  I wouldn't say don't go, far from it as it was a fun night but stick with the Silver Tapas tickets (although you will have to watch the performers backs in some parts for the first 2 parts as the 'stage' is directed towards diners) or maybe Gold at a push. The mark up on the alcohol is high enough (a £13 bottle of wine for £50+) too, I appreciate it is a big undertaking, a lot of staff to pay but don't promise a Diamond experience and deliver something lacklustre.  To note - I didn't complain about the food on the night, it is a mass catering event so everything is pre-made and the servers had enough to do. This is down to the kitchen and management for allowing the sub-standard catering."
41,"Lovely show, fantastic staff, wonnderful three course meal, and the Brazilian singer is an amazing person"
42,"Recently visited,was looking forward to visit this place,but didn't met our expectations at all. Food was terrible!!!! And I'm not pitty ,but for 95£(plus 15%service charge on top) gold package per person was shocking. Drink prices oh dear dear! !! Staff was nice and friendly,but to serve ice cubes into glass from the bucket where was prosseco and other drinks , sorry but really????!!!! Entertainment - I felt I'm in Butlins....not even close to cabaret ... Decor old style,outdated. I would never recommend to go there for price you have to pay and what you will get. Disappointed all I can say."
43,"On the whole, it was a fun evening out. The food was lovely and the actual entertainment was great. What let it down was the service. We had to repeatedly ask for things and even then things we asked for didn’t turn up (prosecco glasses and water) whilst the waiter stood at the back just watching the entertainment. What was most disappointing we paid for a special dessert for a friends 40th, by the time they brought it over the sparkler had long gone out, so that was a waste of money. Thought the DJ music wasn’t fitting to the audience (very much RnB when it was pop fans attending) so we left after just a few songs."
44,"This was the most memorable experience for my 50th birthday celebration visiting from the USA. We booked the experience that included the reception which were drinks and light hors d’oeuvres listening to live music which was the kick off for the full presentation that went on during dinner. It’s definitely a special evening 5star service from the dinner, the staff , the presentation , the performances all TOP NOTCH!!! I loved every minute of it."
45,Took some clients and colleagues on a work night out the The London Cabaret Club. What an absolutely amazing evening from start too finish. We will definitely be back!
46,"Firstly I have never given a 1 star review on TA before so read this with that in mind. We arrived at 6pm for the pre-show advertised on the web page but we’re told our £103 tickets didn’t include this. We were seated on 3 small tables in a corridor off the main bar - we were not allowed to sit or stand in the bar because this is for VIPs! The corridor is the route to the cloakroom so obviously people were passing continuously while we drank our £16-£18 drinks. We were seated at 7.30/45. A plate of 1 piece of bread with 2 smaller bits was on each table. I have never seen such tightness! After starters, the main meal was served circa 9.30pm (a Guinea fowl and a smear of something unknown- you don’t come here for the food and shouldn’t). The waiters served the table to our left and then walked past us to table to our right. The reason- they were there before us. That’s despite us arriving at 6pm. Every part of the evening was controlled and regimented. The show is good but seriously for over £200 per head once you include drinks there must be a better cabaret option than this one! I would never waste my money here again. The only positive was the nice waiter who looked after us. LCC your approach is disgusting and London deserves better."
47,"The best evening in such a long time. Awesome dancing and singing. The service was amazing and the table service from our Brazilian maestro/dancer was top draw. Good bloke, genuine and always prepared to go the extra mile."
48,"We attended the penultimate night of the Great Gatsby themed event and to say it was spectacular and out of this world would be an understatement. Not only were the dancers, singers and performers faultless, the whole experience was one that whisked your night back into the roaring 20s. An absolutely must see and would highly recommend to one and all. Great work from the producers and keep up the fantastic work."
49,"Terrible event, rammed in like sardines, lunch cold, bottomless drinks ?? i would question that! if you can get them to serve you. Spend your money on a show and drinks instead. Its a money making scam for tourists. 3 drinks £47 and a bottle of prossecco £50."
50,Been here a few times now as I love show and dinner experiences and this one never disappoints. Food is always great and the shows are fun. My favourite show is the Gatsby one!
51,"Fantastic afternoon celebrating my 50th with my sisters. Singers, dancers were amazing. Everyone got up to dance and sing. Atmosphere brilliant. Special thank you to Gillian at West End Musical Brunch and James at Sway making it even more special with Moet and care and attention xx"
52,"The food was lovely, the drinks were yummy but most importantly the atmosphere was electric! Loved the dancers and the acts and would highly recommend to anyone wanting a fun night out."
53,"Gatsby Christmas - we attended Fri 3rd Dec on drinks-only tickets. We were disappointed that our table wasn’t ready when we arrived and the staff seemed confused and cobbled something together - 4 people paying £75 each crowded around a poseur table designed for two people at best. The drinks service was fine and attentive. There were some good acts and performers but the show was disjointed and had no flow at all. Poorly planned. Compared to other similar events I’ve been to before, this felt a bit of a let down."
54,"It started of as an occasiin for my partners birthday, then he proposed. Beautiful place & entertainment was amaxing. A nice occasion to get dressed in your best dress. However, as it was my partners birthday I asked for it too be announced, cost £50 for that, total disgrace as already had paid £336 for tickets & 1 bottle of wine. Definitely should be complimentary for birthday announcements etc. Our engagement was not even acknowledged. The staff are all amazing, so professional & helpful. Would highly recommend."
55,"A great evening of entertainment. The performers were talented, particularly Hannah who has an incredible voice. The only thing I'd improve is the food, which was mediocre."
56,"Due to last year's lockdown, we had to rebook our 'London Never Dies' night. Rebooking was easy and we received a confirmation email last month. Although it referred to a menu selection and pre-ordering drinks, we had no further communication from the club until the evening before the performance. After a couple of calls and emails, our menu choice and drinks package was booked and paid for, but it was all very last minute. The performances were all good, with some exceptional singing and a couple of stand-out BGT-type performances. In between the acts, the DJ played plenty of dance music which got people in the mood for when the tables were cleared away towards midnight. Still not entirely sure about the 'act' with one of the singers and a dog....either way, I don't think it went as planned. Our 'Gold package' gave us a choice of meat, vegetarian or vegan options, but with only one choice of starter, main and dessert - but you could mix and match if you wanted a vegetarian starter and a meat main course. Although the entertainment started around 7:45pm, the starters did not come out for over an hour and we received our main course around 10:30pm - even though some tables around us had the mains already cleared away. Maybe understandable, given they are catering at a grand-scale. The other issue is that a number of the waiting staff do not have English as their first language - no problem with that, but my wife asked one member of staff where the toilets were, but she said she did not understand the question. So we had to ask another member of staff who was able to oblige with the necessary directions. As you would expect, the drinks are not cheap, and the cocktails in particular are rather expensive, so if you've not got work the next day, the bar bill might mean you putting in a few hours of overtime. So overall, a good experience, but we're in no hurry to go again.."
57,"I wouldn’t call this a cabaret club, the performance was quite disappointing and resembled a school talent show more than anything. There were a few good acts that saved the night but apart from that it was quite disappointing. A lot of long breaks between the acts too, which made the whole thing rather disjointed. I would not pay full price for this, there are a lot of other better cabaret clubs in London."
58,"I bought 2 silver booth tickets to see the El Dia Of The Dead on Friday 29th October for my hubby's bday. When we arrived at the entrance desk and showed our tickets, there was initially a problem with our table - we were supposed to have table 14 but were then switched to table 31, have no idea why! We were asked to sit down and wait while they sorted this out. Then, once the issue was sorted and we arrived at our table, it took 1 HOUR before we even had a drink! We had no idea who was supposed to be serving us as no one came up to us for a long time. I then just said I would just go up to the bar to order us a drink and was stood there for ages with none of the bar staff even looking at me. It wasn't until I asked if I could order there until I was told that there should be table service and they would send someone over. Finally, a lady came up to us and asked what we would like and noticed we didn't have a drinks menu, so she disappeared off for at least another 20 minutes until she came back with a menu.  We ordered a bottle of (very expensive!) Wine, which was delivered to our table by someone else and just left in the bucket. It hadn't been opened (it had a cork) and we didn't have glasses. We were sat waiting for a long time yet again for our waitress to come over and open the bottle for us! The wine itself was definitely not worth the extortionate price we paid for it either, very sub par.  Everywhere just seemed chaotic and unorganised and we felt forgotten about. The show itself was ok but there was a long wait in between performances, probably to get you to buy more ridiculously priced drinks! They also take away your card at the point of ordering and you only see it again when you leave! I did not feel that this experience deserved a tip so I didn't bother. We left before the performance finished.  We definitely won't be back sadly and was not worth the price we paid! A shame to have experienced this for my Husband's birthday."
59,"Rude bar staff, mediocre entertainment & expensive drinks which are sub par. The Halloween 'after party' was poor, the bar area was drab and dingy and the music was only playing in the main ballroom and only filtered through to the bar through an open door. The event was also promoted at 10:30-3 but we were asked to leave the ballroom at around 2 and music switched off at 3"
60,"The basic package prices are good value for money for a fun night out. You get little more for the more expensive packages and you are treated no differantly. The entertainment is nothing special but the singers are superb. I got the impression, that having listened to Bond music all night on a halloween themed evening, that its just the music from London never dies replayed in halloween costumes. The whole night revolves around alcohol induced excitement so you are guarenteed a loud fun atmosphere. The entertainment is predominantly diversity in later years not a lot of variety. The food was good but a little on the cold side and took forever to be served. The drinks are not cheap so be prepared for an expensive night."
61,"My wife and I had a wonderful time at The London Cabaret Club celebrating our first wedding anniversary. All the staff took excellent care of us; the performers were incredibly talented; the food was delicious (although different from the menu we'd been sent); and the environment was beautiful. One thing that was disappointing was the lack of diversity in the performers- they were all white. Most of the serving staff who were out all the time were white too, with black waiters coming just to deliver food. We felt uncomfortable about the clear race divide in the club and would be interested in reading their diversity and inclusion policy to see what they are doing about this."
62,"It’s an evening full of entertainment, it definitely doesn’t disappoint. The food was good but at least one choice on starter main and pudding would make it great drinks are expensive which overall is to be expected, however the near 15% charge they put on top is very over the top. Bordering on rude…."
63,"I was celebrating my 60th birthday with a friend and we both thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience from start to finish. The performers were polished and very talented, the venue was impressive, all the staff were professional and friendly, the food was great and the DJ certainly had everyone up dancing. We will both definitely be coming back!"
64,Amazing experience! The performances were really good and to a high standard. it is 100% worth the money
65,"I had a very special occasion that was tripled pleasure because of all the support i got from the team , specially Ms Izzy during my reservation and follow up, my partner was crying from happiness and joy, the program was amazing , the night was long enough till 3 am to be part of our happiest memories"
66,"Enjoyed the night, the food was great and the show was amazing. Would highly recommend and would definitely go again."
67,"Purchased the gold tickets for a Saturday night, the entertainment was ok but the food was really awful and the whole thing seemed well overpriced. We were sat at the back and none of the wait staff seemed able to locate our table so kept delivering our drinks and food to other tables, at one point our main courses were left sitting at an empty table for 20 mins and then delivered to us cold, we didn’t bother eating it was that bad! The show was fairly good with some impressive acts but almost as entertaining was the shockingly bad service! We wont be returning unfortunately :("
68,"Amazing night, great performance and music. Great service as well Adrien our waiter was extremely helpful:)."
69,"Show - 5/5. Great singing and dancing.  Seating in theatre - 5/5. Great view of show in VIP seats.  Pre drinks - 1/5. Although we’d pre ordered drinks, these were not offered in pre bar. Therefore, we ordered extra drinks which were very expensive (even for London).  Drinks package - 2/5. Limited beer choice. Expensive. All lager opened as soon as we arrived at table and went flat.  Food - 1/5. Did not consider allergies, albeit pre advised. Cold when served. Canopy - awful. Duck - cold and tough. Fondant - sad.  Service - 1/5. Rushed. Impersonal. Did not consider pre orders or allergies. Did not bring back credit card after 3 requests. Had to go to bar to retrieve.  Overall - not a VIP service. Only saviour for the evening was the entertainment and seating (which I accept are key). Other than that: food awful; drinks overpriced and service poor."
70,"If you are looking to see London in all its glory, please go see a show at the London Cabaret. We had the best seats in the house and the experience was second to non. Geric our waiter made the experience even better by being so good at his job and for our second wedding anniversary we couldn't have asked for a better night.  Food was amazing, drinks were amazing, service was amazing, please if you can, book a ticket to go here.  You will not regret it."
71,"Adrienne was amazing, so Friendly and helpful on our first experience here. I came to celebrate my birthday and had An lovely time. Thoroughly spoilt. Adrienne and Jonathan looked after myself and my husband brilliantly Thank you xxx"
72,This was my fourth visit to the Cabaret Club - each for a special occasion. There was a brilliant party atmosphere - the performances in the cabaret were top-notch (West End show standard) and the food was delicious. All in a stunning art deco ballroom. I live in London am delighted to have found the London Cabaret Club.
73,"Pros: It is a nice evening and wonderful change from the normal nights out in London. The artists are extremely talented and there is a wide selection of performances from dancing to acrobatics. Very entertaining! The food is good. A nice selection on the menu and the drinks are very good (cocktails and quality of wine). The service is a little rushed but nothing too offensive at all. Cons: The only downside for us is that we originally booked Gold tickets, stage side. As the menu was less impressive (chicken), we upgraded to the diamond package. We asked that it was stage side and were told the diamond seats were the best but when we arrived, we were walked to the back of the hall on a raise platform. Our seats were at the back on the side sitting next to each other which meant we had to turn 90 degrees to view the entire show whilst blocking each other and eating on a circular tables. It is as awkward as it sounds.  My best advice is to stay stage side where all the action happens and you feel part of the show. Or maybe to ask for a seating plan ahead of time and base your ticket selection on that.  That aside, it is a great night made special by the performers and the general ambience."
74,"Absolutely fantastic, 17th september show, service was 10/10 performances INCREDIBLE. we finished this night and called some friends to tell them we need to rebook. see you in december!"
75,"Lovely venue, good food, attentive staff and first class entertainment ... all the ingredients for an excellent night out which my wife and I certainly had. Will be visiting again as soon as time allows."
76,"Great evening and enjoyed the dinner, very polite and helpful staff . Would definitely have a return visit"
77,"Good experience but not 100% satisfied. Long gaps between performers. Many staff around but still couldn’t get best table service. Our bottle of wine was left on our table without opening. Twice asked for cutlery, because twice our meal was served just on a plate without the cutlery. A lot of confusion about menu. The show was great but in 2 hours only 30 minutes were the real performers , the rest of the time was DJ’ music."
78,"My boyfriend planned a Saturday evening as part of my birthday surprise last weekend. There was a bond themed cabaret night. The acts were great to watch, however they were quite short and there was very large gaps. The drinks menu was diverse but very pricey with cocktails priced at around £16 each. I would recommend definitely trying this place once"
79,We attended the Carnival evening - the entertainment was pretty good but lots and lots of padding took place and seemed to be a mix of everything thrown together We pre ordered drinks expecting them to be on the table in an ice bucket but no it took about an hour to finally get them Lots of confusion over our food also - there were lots of staff but no one seemed to be able to resolve anything Perhaps the organisers should visit Benidorm palace to see how this night should and could be
80,My husband and I were visiting London for our wedding anniversary and decided to book something different that we haven’t experienced before in London and this did not disappoint! The staff were attentive and our waiter Johnathan was a pleasure to be around very polite and a great conversationalist which made our night too. The food was amazing and well presented and the most important part was the very talented entertainment we received throughout the whole night. It was spectacular and exciting and we would definitely return to experience another evening like this at the London cabaret club.
81,"We enjoyed the night. Initially concerned about the ticket price but given that we were in a well spaced venue we believe we had value for money. It was very noticeable that many tables, including ours were restricting their drink purchases because of the the extortionate prices. I became increasingly agitated by the inhouse photographer constantly walking in front of us and on more than one occasion told him to move. I paid to see a show not the back of the head of your publicity staff. The night was themed as Carnival but other totally unrelated acts were put into the show to pad out the event. They were good but left us confused as to why they were included as they bore to relationship to carnival. Having seen the Rio Carnival in 2020 we can definately say the Brazilian part of the night was very authentic The evening was disjointed with long gaps between each set of entertainment, these gaps were filled with some guy with angel wings banging a drum which after the first circuit became annoying rather than entertaining. The food was spread over 2 hours which for a meal was well dragged out, the dishes were surprisingly tasty but served tepid. Best advice is to eat before the show, drink well before the show, buy the drinks only ticket and just buy a beer for the duration"
82,"Booked the Cabaret for the James Bond show! My partner and I were greeted by the young ladies at the front desk, both were very polite and helpful throughout the night, catered to both me and my wife with amazing service. Unfortunately, I was a witness to poor management half way through my night, from what I could see the manager kept raising his voice to employees. I was also waiting for quite a while to speak with the young lady from the desk, but could see she was caught up with the manager who seemed to be acting quite inappropriate and unprofessional. All in all the show and performers were amazing… however service and management were below the standards of what I was expecting."
83,"An absolutely amazing evening, filled with spectacular talent and superb cuisine, surrounded in great company of friends! The hosts were so attentive, it truly felt so wonderful to enjoy being wined and dined all over again- we didn't want this evening to end! There is honestly not a bad seat in the house. Thanks to all at The London Cabaret Club: 100% 5*"
84,I took my mum to London Cabaret club for her birthday and I wasn't sure what to expect because I hadn't really heard anything good or bad about it. It was fantastic. The food and entertainment were spot on. It was a great evening
85,The service was quite poor and somewhat rude. We were put sitting in an empty area where we couldn't experience any of the entertainment until we asked to be moved. We were moved eventually but felt like half the night was wasted.
86,"Brilliant food, service was above and beyond, show was excellent and the members of staff made the night by getting involved and making sure the best night was had by all. Most definitely recommend."
87,Amazing show with lots of performances. The singers had amazing voices and the dancers were really good. Was served by Adrian throughtout the night. He was so helpful and lovely. This was my first cabaret show and certainly won't be my last 😊
88,"Not great acts, very slow service, average food.  Worst cabaret I’ve ever seen, would recommend proud or black cat or the smaller crazy coqs.  For example an unexpected dog act; the dog just came onto the stage waited, the trainer pleaded with it, and then it ran off with out doing any tricks."
89,"All round quality experience!! I took my friend who came over from Belfast and we chose the gold package to go all out and I’m so pleased we did. We pre ordered our cocktails prior to arrival for the whole night so there was nothing to settle and they already had a list of our wanted drinks for the night and preferred meal choices, so you literally turn up and are served on. We were sat right in front of the stage and the food was absolutely divine. The show, service with a smile and atmosphere made such a welcoming and classy experience. Even the after party just topped everything off! I would recommend to all!"
90,best show we have been too for years from start to finish. all the staff superb especially victoria c. food was piping hot and top class show was really entertaining .can not recommend this show enough you wont be disappointed. we booked gold tickets they were perfect
91,"My partner and i went there for our 12 anniversary and booked it online that day- we didn’t really know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised how amazing it was. There wasn’t a dull moment. The performers were just brilliant. Dancing was amazing- costumes beautiful, we will definitely return x"
92,We were so excited to she our first show since the pandamic. Actually able to go out for an evening. Singers & coriograghy very amiture. Drinks expensive. Good DJ though
93,"Brilliant atmosphere, great food, exceptional service and a spectacular performance. Highly recommend!"
94,"Great night out, fun atmosphere and tasty food. Really friendly, happy, helpful staff. Drinks a little pricey...."
95,"We were seated on high stools which my friends had difficxulty getting on. A member of staf must have noticed as we were soon moved to a booth with banquette seating,much easier and safer for them. We still had a good view of the stage. The costumes were spectacular,even involving glittery masks!"
96,"We had an unexpectedly wonderful eveing. Great welcome, great singer, great location and fantastic DJ and dancing in the ailes. Food up to expectation and wine not cheap but what an evening and so surprising. We will be back for halloweeen."
97,Brilliant night start to finish staff were lovely and the show was brilliant defiantly recommend this club to small groups or couples
98,"After several attempts of seeing this show (due to pandemic) we finally managed to see the show at The London Cabaret and it was worth it the waiting. The whole process of booking the food and drink was really good so we didn't need to worry about that and the show went through out our dinner which was perfect. Really good show, amazing cast and DJ. A really different night in London"
99,"Everything was going well: the changes of dates were accommodated without any problems, the phone calls regarding menu were consistent. But when we came in as VIP canopies were sent with gluten, although during the call and an email confirmation stressed out ""gluten free"". Instead of canopies we received our starters which also were vegetarian section menu. For such a place and for such money I was expecting the chef to have an understanding that ""gluten free"" doesn't mean we don't eat meat! Offering vegetarian options! We didn't get a discount for this mistake overall the show was lovely and I would visit again but my hopes wouldn't be as high as I expected in the first place. And I wouldn't pay for VIP option either. Visibility of the show was excellent for everyone, I ate vegetarian options so I could have saved around 60 pounds on normal ticket."
100,Great evening / entertainment and acts very good / if it hadn’t been fir COVID restrictions it would have turned into a late night of dancing …. Recommended
101,"The show is great but that about it!  We were celebrating our anniversary and my husbands birthday. The day hadn't started well for us so we were late and missed dinner service. Wasn't too bummed about it as it was our fault but paying £250 for the package, i would have excepted great service and perhaps an option to dine in one of the other rooms so as not to disrupt the service in the main room.  Anyhow, my rating is purely based on the service we received and the overall experience and slightly influenced by management response when we approached them to share our experience; 1. I had organised a surprise anniversary and birthday wish from the performers to my husband. Apparently, they went ahead and wished him before we arrived. Management said 'we had just missed the announcement'. How do you wish someone when you know they haven't arrived? 2. We were supposed to get 2 free cocktails with our package. We were charged for all our drinks. When we brought it up, we were told we should have reminded the staff. I would expect the staff to have been briefed about the packages of all tables 3. We informed them during our booking that we do not drink alcohol. The drinks that were were served came with shots. The waiter also confirmed that it was alcoholic and we passed them on to the next table (who appreciated and enjoyed it). Management claimed it was soda water 4. We were seated at the worst table in the venue, even the standard package had better seats. We had 4 waiters constantly stationed next to us and all the traffic to serve drinks/food/ to go the bathroom was by our table. We saw most of the people's heads than the show. Felt like we were penalized for being late despite having paid and reserved the table. Late or not, we paid for it. 5. It felt like it was ladies night. The DJ kept playing ladies night music and it was just horrible. A stunt to get people to leave early perhaps?  When we brought all this up with management, they were defensive and just kept giving excuses. They offered us a 25% discount for the next show. Quiet insulting as that would be about £62 off a £250 package. of which apprx. £30 is the overcharge on the drinks that were supposed to complimentary. so... in short, we were offered £32 pounds off the next show. I am sorry if that doesn't excite me.  Was the show good, yes. Will i go back? No. Would i recommend it? I haven't mentioned it to anyone yet so..."
102,"The show was fun and exciting, it’s a great option for a weekend evening night out. The cocktails were great too."
103,We had the worst experience of our lives. The food was rubbish. I have eaten better in McDonalds. I was given the run around by untrained staff who knew nothing of the venue. When I phoned to complain the next day it took them nearly a week to phone me back and then they fobbed me off with excuses. I wasted over £300.00 buying Platinum seats that we never used due to stupid part time staff aand no compensation for their error.Do not waste your time with this venue you will have more fun watching paint dry.
104,"booked for my partner birthday on gold setting , service and show was excellent, only let down was I booked and paid for Celebration slice of cake with sparklers but they only drop the cake on table without any candles or sparklers which was very disappointing and celebrating was the whole purpose of the booking. Apart that I would highly recommend it."
105,Had a lovely evening at the cabaret with waiters like Adrien who are so attentive and kind. An absolutely amazing night with my 10 girlfriend.
106,"We didn't know what to expect after we have seen a fantastic cabaret in Paris. The show was amazing and an overall experience was way much better than Paris one - you have an amazing show, live sax, fantastic meal and service, add DJ playing some great tunes and dancing into the night - for me it was a perfect cocktail for the very perfect night out. I am already planning to return for my birthday because there is no hassle of going for drinks somewhere, then for dinner somewhere and the ghastly thought of queueing up for a night club! Quality time at London Cabaret."
107,"From the moment we arrived it was amazing, the venue, the dancers and singers, the staff, the cocktails and the food 10/10 couldn’t fault it - drinks flowed the show was brilliant and the food tasted amazing. DJ was brilliant everything almost felt normal again it was a brilliant thank you all so much - we will be back again"
108,Had a great night at Cabaret Club last week. Loved the show and the food was amazing. Staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive especially Constantin who looked after us for the duration of the night. Definitely will be going there again in the future.
109,"Amazing show, excellent entertainment!! A night full of amazing dance and the show like no other! I loved every second of it."
110,"I’m a big James Bond fan and had very low expectations going into this. I’ve never been to cabaret before and thought it might come off as “tacky” or “Karaoke”. Much to my surprise the singers were very good, especially one of the men who had amazing vocal range and made Sam Smith’s Writing’s On The Wall from Spectre very listenable! There were some impressive acrobatics and more Bond songs which kept me engaged. A couple of “filler” acts such as the “laser girl” were absolutely awful and served no purpose though. The 3 course meal was actually very edible which was surprising. Any Bond aficionado would have a good time here and it’s a good night out for a group of you even if you aren’t into the world’s most famous, fictional spy."
111,"I can't say enough good things about the London Cabaret Club. Staff were welcoming and attentive from the start. There was an air about the place that you were attending something special (some people attend in black tie) but there was no particular dress code and it did not feel pretentious. Although drinks were expensive, this is massively offset by the value of the tickets. The entertainment was exquisite. The performances impeccable, the choreography and costuming beautiful. The performers were just fantastic. There were three acts with a lively DJ keeping everyone entertained between set changes. The best thing about this event was that you get to experience the talents of the west end but in a more intimate setting but you also get the party atmosphere of being in a club. Absolutely love love loved this, best night out since before Covid! Can't wait to come back for a Halloween or Christmas show! Thanks for the memories London Cabaret Club!"
112,"Fun filled evening out Fantastic DJ wicked playlist for all music types Beautiful venue, Waiting staff are very attentive, helpful and courteous. Show and performances is wow amazing . A real party atmosphere. Mixologist lovely cocktails James Bond theme."
113,Best atmosphere and great service! Shout out to the sexy saxophone guy :) and to our excellent waiter Addrian (soz for spelling) such personable service and a great French gent :) big love! A great experience
114,"A James Bond turned festive medley that would have Sean Connery turning in his grave.  The service was atrocious - 90% of our orders were incorrect and the staff had the audacity to react as though we were the ones in the wrong! That didn’t stop them from trying to charge the inflated amount though....plus a service charge for the inconvenience! Thorough ineptness from start to finish - never again!  As for the entertainment....average at best. Despite paying for Gold tickets...we were very nearly sat in the next room - which wasn’t necessarily a bad thing had it not cost quite so much - and delivered so very little! Aside from one or two performers, the remainder was akin to a dreadful karaoke night in your local pub and a cabaret worthy of Phoenix Nights. I feel thoroughly disappointed and disenchanted by my experience - it was entirely shabby!  The roller-skating duo were by far the highlight. A true skill and hugely entertaining - other than that, the night was little more than a huge disappointment....and most definitely not the night we’d signed up for.  Having been to Lio a year or so ago at the same venue, tonight came a very distant second.....and one that I very much begrudge paying for."
115,"We had an amazing night, the food was incredible and the show 10/10. All the staff were really friendly, especially Constantine. Would recommend this experience to anyone, very much worth the money,"
116,"This may appear like an expensive adventure, however, it is worth every penny, and let’s face it, we all drop £££ on a London night out.  The food: not the greatest, but that’s quite normal for an establishment that isn’t a restaurant.  The drinks: an array of choice from average wine and beer to delicious champagne and cocktails.  Service: attentive and friendly  The performance: PHENOMENAL. Heart-warming, outstanding, breath-taking and incredibly enjoyable. The performers themselves were next level!  I advise that you dress up. You don’t need to but it really does add to the overall effect and enjoyment of the evening."
117,"Booked a royal diamond VIP table for 2 which gave us a great meal, view and overall experience. It was definitely worth the money. I am looking forward to returning next year when hopefully the restrictions will be lifted and can party the night away. Very friendly staff and great show. I have even received an extra desert for my birthday and a drink for myself and my husband. Really good show and atmosphere considering Boris was announcing a second lockdown same evening. The lengths the staff went to ensure safety but also a fab show are incredible. I feel sorry for them as they are unable to work throughout as everything was very well managed and it definitely felt safe. The stake was really good as it was the rest of the meal but I remember the stake the most as it really was great The only thing I would do different would be to pre order the drinks as you get a discount bit even without it we had an incredible night."
118,Epic!!! Excellent night and great/friendly staff. Would highly recommend and would love to go again!
119,"Everything was amazing! Show was fab, food and drinks were great and Avram looked after us so well and catered to our every need! Thanks Avram and everyone at Cabaret Club!"
120,I love the show also I saw a nice dog on the stage. Definitely I will come again and avram make us a good service.
121,"After long time we went out, the Show was great service was great, also Thanks for Avram for the service. We recommend the venue. Must visit"
122,"Had such an amazing night.. I booked this venue as a suprise for my Husbands birthday im so happy I decided to go here... The food was fabulous and the service was excellent, staff were so friendly and the show was fantastic. Special thanks to Jerick who was looking after our table, thank you all for an awesome night. Will definitely visit again."
123,"I was disappointed to see one of the entertainers use a number of live birds in the performance (All About Gatsby). The birds were kept in confined spaces and I’m sure the loud music and flashing lights would be distressing for them. Suggestion to the venue would be to make it clear during the booking process that live animals are used in the performance, we would not have attended if we had known"
124,"Everything was perfect, I booked the Diamond package for £125pp without drinks and I would within a heart beat book it again. The place and the theme are so well arranged, the food is delicious, the staff friendly and the show...there is just no word for it. I was seriously so happy all through the evening and my guests (coming from France for the occasion) were absolutely delighted. I have been sharing pictures and talking about it with everyone I could."
125,"Food and drink service terrible. We kept getting missed out and had to keep asking. Duck was dry and chewy. Asked for my cocktail as soon as we sat on table, I had to ask again during main course, only to be told its not available! Show was ok... expected a Gatsby theme to be more Gatsby but they kept playing these noisy club songs during intervals, some songs sang were remotely related to Gatsby, not even its genre. Shame the performers were good. I was looking forward to this night but got very disappointed. Might want to change show title or keep within the theme? Cloakroom - had to ask if there was one,none offered at entry/ reception. On way out to collect, coats given and they completely forgot bag, again we had to ask after about 10-15 mins waiting"
126,"booked to go with a group of 13 for my 21st. We travelled for two and a half hours to get there, one of my friends were travel sick and was sick in the toilet. She was kicked out for this meaning we all had to leave after an hour of the show beginning. We explained to them that she had recently had an operation and that it was due to the travelling but no one would listen. We were with an older group, some aged 70 and still couldn’t not get listened to. We spoke to the manager, Mike, who was so so rude! He did not understand at all and was very sarcastic and patronising. An awful experience & my 21st birthday was ruined as a result. When we first arrived we had been accused of hiding our drinks under the table by 2 staff members- we did not do this and even showed them under our table. We wasn’t offered an apology for this accusation. The food had been ordered with one vegan dish, yet all 13 of us received a vegan meal. Food was cold, alcohol was cheap and struggled to get much alcohol as we would have to wait until all finishing our drinks before receiving another one and sometimes had to wait up to 15 mins to be served. I would definitely not recommend this as a place to go. Very very inconsiderate and rude staff. We spent nearly £800 amongst us to be forced out after an hour. Do not waste your money"
127,I attended the Great Gatsby show with friends and particularly enjoyed the charleston danse moves and the high end acrobatics. Lovely jazzy atmosphere with attentive staff and talented artists. The performance was dynamic as you are immersed in a continuous flow of acts that unfolds around you. A great opportunity to sit back and be entertained in a stunning art deco ballroom. There is a possibility to party and danse at the end of the show if you want to linger for a while. Great place to party with a group of friends.
128,"Just wanted to take a moment to compliment the service we received from Avram on Saturday evening. My girlfriend and I had a lovely overall experience - both in terms of spectating an exquisite cabaret show performed by a group of professional dancers and the customer service side - which was way above standards as a result of the outstanding effort of Avram and the rest of the team ever since we arrived and throughout the evening.  All in all, very impressed with the 10/10 customer care and we will definitely come back again soon."
129,"good food, great preformace and really kind staff! If you like dance and singing preformace this is a place to visit."
130,We have just walked out of the show. It’s was tediously boring. The concept and the show has so much potential but it’s so boring and the food is just meh. It’s trying to be this posh venue with posh food but it is horrid. The lamb and desert was nice but the other course were not. We left before the final course because we were just board. The performers are talented but the set up does nothing for them. Disappointing and a waste of £250
131,All the acts were extremely entertaining. Drinks are expensive but similar to any upmarket restaurant in central London.
132,"17 of us arrived here for my friends 40th birthday party, wasn’t very impressed when we arrived no tables to sit at just stood around waiting for 40 minutes until we could go through to the show area. Loved all the dancers and they had amazing outfits, the magician was excellent and still don’t know where the parrot came from, the food was ok nearly all ours was cold when it came to us. But the show made up for this, we loved that we could get up and dance, we thought the bottles of Prosecco were a bit over priced as well."
133,This was a lovely experience. Six of us did the dinner and show experience and it was met with consistent compliments from our table. Would definitely recommend to anyone. The pre drinks in the bar are also an amazing prelude to the overall experience.
134,We were a group of friends who just wanted to see a fun dancing show. The Cabaret Club had amazing 3 dancing acts. The dancers had beautiful outfits that matched the theme and they really kept us entertained. I would definitely go back again.
135,"I was with my friends to London Cabaret, We had pre-drinks and a nice lounge and after the show starts we got a nice table and we want to thanks to Avram for a wonderful night. You must visit"
136,Avram looked after us whilst we were out for our company Christmas Party last Thursday night and I have to say that he was the best waiter that I have ever had. There was a large group of us but Avram was always there to get us what we needed in a flash. Highly recommend this venue for corporate events or work parties. Give the man a raise!
137,"I think if you were drunk and someone else was paying for your night out here, it would be great. However, at about £15 for a margarita and £19 for a glass of champagne, we limited ourselves to a drink each. The entertainment came in 3 batches, with long periods of noisy chart dance music inbetween. It was all a bit flat - a few magicians (one using live animals), dancers (some of the women's costumes were spectacular I have to admit) and a cute dog called Maisie who did a few tricks. But the entire point of the evening was really to sell as many of their overpriced drinks as possible to groups of drunken work parties. Staff were mostly very attentive and friendly - except the woman on the reception who looked like she'd like to be doing anything else rather than dealing with you. Overall, it had a very soulless feel to it. I would definitely not go again."
138,"Took my wife in her birthday with son and daughter and had a really wonderful night of entertainment. The service was superb throughout, food very good but the entertainment was special. They kept us entertained for two hours with spectaculars, truly getting the audience involved. We will return!"
139,Wonderful experience with friends. Great talented people on stage! Beautiful Christmas decorations as you enter the place and nice atmosphere. You can see the stage in any area you sit in. The staff was great!
140,"From when we first walked in, until we left. Felt like you were special, the ambiance, food, show amazing. Not cheap but worth every penny."
141,"Don’t be tempted by the wonderful descriptions on the website, this is a rip-off. Drinks are overpriced, service is poor, cabaret is a joke but like all gourmet restaurants they do serve margarine with your bread at dinner. If you want to be mugged, buy a ticket."
142,"really good evening , cabaret was fantastic and went on for a long time , food was delicious and service very good, overall great night out , only negative was the price of drinks was horrendous!"
143,"Horrifically bad high school musical calibre entertainment. We left after a couple of acts. £16 for a gin and tonic made with the cheapest of gin. Our tickets were free and I still feel like we were robbed. I can only imagine that the 5 star reviews are from staff. That, or people from a parallel universe where the good version of this show is happening."
144,"Very high end and classy establishment near Holborn station!! An expensive evening out, but well worth the price you pay as the entertainment is phenomenal! Live singers & musicians accompany each cabaret act to create a spectacular show! It was amazing to see the amount of work the artists put into the Queen of Roses to create a really special show! Even the costumes used were over the top and unforgettable! We didnt have dinner but we ordered a few luxury cocktails at about £10-15 per drink. They offer an extremely small selection of beer here, but unfortunately no cider. Completely out of our budget but we still had a great time!"
145,"Booked this as an anniversary celebration. Wish i had read the tripadvisor reviews first, however I only ever look at these when i am travelling out of my hometown. Trash from start (I cant say to finish) as could tolerate the absolute joke of apparent entertainment. The bar service was slow, overpriced and despite booking to pay for seats the place was full and people were almost sitting on our laps, the food was cold, only had the canapes, and starter as the 3rd course was luke warm at best, we asked for a replacement and this was again not up to serving standard. Gave up and asked for the bill. Was offered a bottle of wine but this would have meant having to stay and finish watching the entertainment and it was embarrassing to watch. I know that everyone has a living to earn but i would guess that the show was thrown together in half hour and I almost felt sorry for the acts. You would have had to be off your trolley to have found it entertaining. Was given the operations manager detailed info and did write an e mail with my feedback but heard nothing. He perhaps agreed with me. Tickets were £250 with a booking fee of £25. Along with a bar bill of £100 made a very expensive night and left feeling like we had been mugged. You have been warned, save your money!"
146,"I am very disappointed . Intially i waited 45 minutes for a a table, and once we went over and me and my mum sat down the chair was not stable and once sitting at the table with my mum after a while the chair collapsed and broken and fallen on my foot, which has caused me great pain but I did not want to leave or make a scene as my mum wanted to visit this restraunt as it was recommended by her friends. The service was terrible. the staff did not immediately attend the table for help or to even change the chair that was broken after a very long time... I then requested for the bill and had to wait a disappointing time almost on a hour.. Health and safety and customers are clearly not a priority here. Once I was paying for the bill they took my card AWAY from the table on arrival and once giving the card back they gave me another persons card by accident, which shows that the staff has no awareness or care for other peoples property and could have accidently given my card to someone else if I had not double checked the card that I was taking home with me. I do not recommend this restraint at all, they did not even have the curtesy to apologise or take money for the bill. I have now had to find a lawyer to assist me with this case as I do not believe that I have attended a peaceful meal to leave with an injured foot. I understand that that trip advisor has a policy on writing fake reviews, this is not fake I would recommend you spend your money elsewhere!"
147,"1) WITHOUT THE DANCERS, THE SINGERS, THE ARTISTS AND THE INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCES THAT PLACE HAS NO VALUE, loved it!!!!  2)the FOOD was LITTLE, when i read ''5 course meal'' me and my friend didn't eat all day !!!!!!! coz we thought the food was massive . But actually ... we were constantly hungry, I felt like it was a constant STARTER. we wished we ate earlier . The salmon main / LAST meal was good.  I wish i could FINISH MY CHEESECAKE instead of them taking it away after few minutes. i usually LIKE to take my time to eat when i spend over 300 £ for an evening, thanx.  3) '' Royal Diamond PAckage'' = you can socialise witht he stars in the lounge with exclusive VIP area and DJ = == *** Artists don't want to socialise, they were obvously tired and they wanted to relax after the show. + Lounge area? socialise?!? 50 - 60 -70 year old DRUNK half sleepy / FAT people and milfs dancing like hoes and going home after few minutes you call that socialise?  WHAT VIP AREA!? the tiny space of sofa in the middle of the room with a few plates of cheese and bread on the table without extra care or extra attention to us ?  I'm not sure how it works in London, maybe 300 £ is very LITTLE price in order to demand attention and care,sorry! but at least don't make it SOUND BIGGER THAN WHAR IT IS PLEASE! BECAUSE IF I KNEW IT, i would have eaten OUT first and then come to see the performance."
148,Fabulous show and food! Beautiful surroundings and a really lovely night out for myself and my teen daughter. Will come back and highly recommend.
149,"I booked this last minute with a friend as we were in the area and wanted to see a show. It was fun. We saw the 'Queen of Roses' show which had a variety of performances. The performers and musicians were fabulous and our waiter was friendly.  We only took the silver package, which I am pleased about because I could't really identify the value of the more highly priced packages. Our seating was fine - our view was clear and unobstructed. Some of the performance was directed towards the opposite side of the room (VIP section), but I suppose they need to give that side something for the price that they had paid relative to us. The food is a set menu so you get what you are given and quite expensive for what I saw people getting. We were much better off going to a nice restaurant beforehand. The alcohol was extremely overpriced.  In all a fun night and a good one-off experience."
150,"We were a group of 10 ladies and we visited the London cabaret show on 26th October so it was decorated for Halloween. It is a beautiful venue. We arrived in time for half price cocktails which were incredible. The bar staff were lovely and had a bit of banter with us. Whilst we were in the bar area there were singers and entertainment whilst we were waiting to be seated. We had great seats but to be honest the stage is in the centre of the room, so all seats are good. Because we were a big group we pre ordered drinks which were at the table waiting for us. The staff were so friendly and accommodating and also had laugh with us. The show was incredible, we loved every minute of it and I’m already planning my next trip to the London cabaret show."
151,"Not my sort of place at all. Visited to hear a cricketing talk given by two former England players. The venue reminded me of the cabaret/casino clubs I used to visit in the North East when I was at university - all velvet, chrome and dark corners. Plainly I am not target market for this type of venue and there is no accounting for personal preference, but I do have a strong preference for not paying more than £30 for 4 small bottles of mainstreanm Belgian beer (Leffe Brun 330 cl)."
152,"I was immersed into a showstopping extravaganza of top class dining combined with a cabaret fusion of song, dance, opera and circus which frankly put Strictly Come Dancing into the shade.  From the moment I entered this glitzy Bloomsbury Ballroom, the whole place buzzed with an ambiance of eclectic mix of music and dance. Dazzled by immaculately choreographed performances in Queen Of Roses and Hats, Horses and Hounds, with colourful costumes and superb attention to detail, it took me on a unforgettable trip through English history.  In the heart of West End only 4 minutes walk from Holborn tube station, you can forget Theatreland and head straight for The London Cabaret Club for a jaw-dropping cabaret experience like no other. Eat and be tantalised: A must see show!"
153,"First time, did not know what expect. Did not book the meal. The lady at reception found our name on the list and gave us card with our table number and told us to proceed downstairs. Downstairs, was cloakroom £2 per person. Greeted and welcomed by people who would later take part in the performance. they were dressed in aristocratic costume. Proceeded to bar located at end of long corridor. Lady singing. Whole decor, singer's costume like from early 20th century. Ordered non-alcoholic cocktail priced at £10.35.Bartender made it in front of us. Delicious. Later we proceeded to ballroom. Hostess took us to our table, which was located next to the central raised stage.Next to us aisle for walking then the tables and seating on the perimeter. Some customers ordered food and drink.Later the performance started. Then break for some food and drink. also dancing. Some customers danced by their tables. Then more performance. Another break and then more performance. After performance finished, customers danced on the centre stage. Out glasses were topped up with tap water without having to request. The performance included variety of dance styles and costumes, also singing, instruments being played, acrobats. It is all live and happens next to us and around us. Great buzz created by this, especially from the energy of the performance right next to us. Customers dressed in full tuxedo or shirt or T-shirt for males and evening dresses to casual wear for females. There was no pressure to buy the drinks or food. Cocktails cost £15.The performance is free. It is an overall experience of drink, food, entertainment, dancing. Fantastic!"
154,"Beautiful venue, very well designed and decorated. Fantastic food served, wonderful wines, amazing band and dj to dance the night away."
155,"What a great place! We took our 3 girls here to celebrate one of them becoming the grand old age of 21! We arrived early for the half price cocktails which is definitely worth doing. They were delicious but otherwise would have been, as cocktails are, expensive. The decor of club is really well done. A little quirky and rather glamorous, perfect. We had good seats and throughly enjoyed the show. So why not 5 stars from me you may be wondering...I ordered a cake and champagne for our table, this is one of their packages and not cheap at £150 but as I expected at a club like this. They arrived in one of the intervals but there was no candle on the cake like I was promised, no plates or a knife for the cake and no glasses for the champagne! Eventually we opened the champagne ourselves and used our water glasses to drink it...we decided we would save the cake and take it with us. At the end of the show we asked someone for a box, he took the cake away and that was the last we ever saw of it...I left before my girls but when they asked about the cake no one seemed to know about it. Having since emailed about it I have had no response at all...hence 3 stars from me not 5... Such a shame as things like that always leaves bad taste in your month, it certainly wasn’t the nice chocolate taste I was hoping for!"
156,"Easy to find - bit strange when you first enter to give your name - poor girl was working from the light on her phone and struggled to see the names of the bookings. We were directed downstairs - we arrived just in time for the show so can't really comment on the comfort of the bar area. We were seated promptly - nice little table for two near the front of the stage, we decided not to book the meal package and just planned on having a nice bottle of prosecco to watch the entertainment. After sitting there for an hour (no exaggeration) being completely ignored by the waiters ,,,, they were not making eye contact with people and seemed to only be interested in serving those people who had purchased the food package....it actually became quite humorous for us seeing how long they could ignore people for. In the end my husband went to the bar and purchased a drink for each of us ...TIP the drinks are cheaper at the bar although strangely they still add a service charge. So at the end of the day we were happy to spend £50plus on drinks but didn't spend anything near that - but saved ourselves some money and the venue lost out due to lack of service.  The entertainment however was very good. Lots of variety and well planned out. The only negative act was the poor dog - not sure what the point was as he was rather large and literally just walked through the guys legs ... was a bit weird.  Singers were very good as were the dancers. The lady with the violin was outstanding and the acrobats were amazing too. There was also a prerecorded horse race where you could win tickets for their next show.  All in all a good night out - just wish they treated all their customers the same. The non food option is not cheap so deserve a decent service."
157,"Myself and my daughter's godmother took my daughter for her 30th birthday to, ""Hats,heels and horses.""  We were entertained from the beginning to the end. Beautiful and creative outfits,wonderful voices,amazing violinist.  Acrobatics,exciting dancing,wonderful choreography creating a great atmosphere in which we felt free to dance, sing,scream and generally immerse ourselves in the whole experience.  The food was good, the waiters efficiently attentive and friendly,service excellent including recognition of my daughter's birthday and others with a cake, decorated plate and flare.  So much talent displayed in one evening! It was a feast for the senses!"
158,"My partner and I visited the London Cabaret Club and we had an amazing time. We were greeted with a smile and escorted to the bar to await entrance to the ballroom. The disabled facilities on entrance were very suitable and on entering the bar space we were able to relax in style. We were escorted to our table and seated where we had a delightful young man act as our personal host for the evening. The food we had was delicious especially the lamb. The Show !!! I found this show very polished and highly entertaining. Exquisite costumes and a great variety of acts . We thoroughly enjoyed the show. I was pleasantly surprised that the management arranged for a special birthday treat for me ,totally unexpected but an amazing thought from them. I would recommend an evening out at The London Cabaret Club to all. We hope to return one day soon to experience another unique show . Thank you to all the staff and management."
159,"This was a night out for our wedding anniversary, and it was a fantastic evening. We only had drinks, and I think we made a good decision. Can't comment on the quality of the food, but for the price I would rather go somewhere else for a nice meal and then concentrate on the show with drinks. Entertainment was of a very high standard, service from all staff was very good and yes drinks a bit expensive, but I guess it goes with the territory if your having a night out in London. Our waiter/server, Adrian provided an excellent table service for drinks and snacks and finding us a nice table for drinks after the show, which made it that extra special. Polite and courteous. Great night, and would recommend, and if you get Adrian its a bonus!"
160,"Wow, what an amazing show! went 10th Aug with my friend, we had such a great time! Amazing stylish venue, great performers, stunning costumes and terrific cast! One of the best London shows I've ever seen by far. Also thoroughly enjoyed the three-course dinner, stayed till very late after the show at the bar, the DJ was really good! you can dance and enjoy a drink or two after the show till very late (left at 2a.m.) which is definitely a plus… Overall a truly amazing experience, highly recommend if you are ever in London! Ada x"
161,"Beware the false reviews on line. This is terrible and a complete rip off  Its cruise ship cabaret at best. Terrible service , ludicrously expensive food and drink and then some of the most poorly devised choreography ever. Some of the acts were clearly embarassed to be associated with the event. Its just naff.  More Butlins than Bloomsbury.  The scariest bit about it all is the number of clearly false reviews both on here and other sites.  You have been warned."
162,"The show was absolutely amazing, the atmosphere al the staff were brilliant and friendly. However if I were to come back I would not do the dinning option as honestly the food was terrible.... Burnt bread as a starter then Smoked Salmon with basically a horrible tasting coleslaw, the meat had so much fat on it and then the dessert was a cheesecake that I couldn’t even eat. I ended up being so hungry as I couldn’t eat the food. Such a shame as the show and venue really is amazing."
163,We had the Gold package and made use of the Happy Hour before 7 p.m. The meal was good considering there were a lot of people to serve. The wine is very expensive and we were originally given bottled water rather than tap water (we should have been more assertive!). The service was good and the cabaret show was excellent - with a high standard of dancing and some great acrobatics. Not enough cubicles in the Ladies loo though!!!
164,"I took my mum for her Birthday so it was meant to be a very special occasion.  The show itself was pretty good - the dancers worked their socks off but it wasn't quite the glamorous and show-stopping affair that had been advertised.  The food was mediocre - for the £75 per ticket I spent, I was expecting a lot more for my money (the lamb main course was the best course but even that came with a small dollop of mash and 1 baby carrot)  The service was atrocious to be honest. It was chaotic, manic and there didn't seem to be enough staff for the amount of guests present. As soon as we were seated we were told there had been a mistake and were asked to move to a table behind - which hadn't even been set! No cutlery, no napkins, nothing! If you're going to move people because they are seated at the wrong table (which is the venues problem, not ours) then at least have the table ready and waiting. We had no dessert cutlery so when it came to dessert, I had to chase someone to give us cutlery. I had to ask multiple times for the simplest of things - a jug of tap water for the table. This was brought over, our server poured the water and then went to walk off with the jug - I had to tell him we'd like the jug for the table, he almost looked confused by such a request. I ordered the Bubbles Package which included a bottle of wine - I wasn't given a choice of red or white so when we got to our table, a white wine was waiting for us (my mum and I are big red wine drinkers) I had to ask 3 times to get it swapped. I specifically emailed to tell them it was my mums birthday and was told they would do sparklers and a special treat (when this happened, there were so many celebrations going on but clearly the waiters hadn't been told exactly what table they are going to as I had to grab a waiter who looked lost and point to my mum so he could give her the surprise - her sparkler had gone out by the time she got it so I wasn't very pleased by that either.  For an event that happens often and also pulls in big crowds, they really need to up their game when it comes to the service. There just weren't enough staff to ensure everything ran smoothly - it was chaotic and the fact that the simplest of things were missed is not acceptable. The staff were not very helpful and our Maitre'D was almost verging on rude.  I'm afraid I won't be recommending this venue to friends or family - for the money I paid, it really wasn't worth it and it is upsetting and disappointing that this put a dampener on my mums birthday evening."
165,Me and my husband came for dinner on the 6th July. My husband got tickets for the event from tickets for troops as a sort of date night for us. When we arrived we upgraded from silver to gold so as to be able to have the meal.  When we entered the ballroom we were sat at a table. After being seated for about five minutes our cutlery were cleared away. Confused we tried to get someone’s attention to clear it up. After al we had paid to upgrade. After about 10 minutes we spoke to a lady who took the information and we got our cutlery back. Just as starters were coming out we had noticed that we didn’t have bread on our table. A little thing but we had paid for it just as everyone else. We got the bread with the starter after complaining. Twice. When the main meals were brought out ours were last again. Brought out once others were being cleared away so I’m guessing a last minute reminder to them. Finally came the third course which I’ll remind you again we had paid for. We waited. Everyone else finished and cleared away. To be just a constant exclusion or last thought was infuriating. I spoke to a gentleman and explained how angry I was. After all we just wanted to be treated the same as everyone else. Yet we were constantly treated less important. He asked what it was I wanted. I replied the dessert but to feel like we mattered. It took me about five to ten minutes to just get him to listen and understand. He gave me my Coca Cola for free and said he would get the cheesecake to take away. This felt like absolutely nothing. But we had to get home so I explained I would make a formal complaint afterwards. We had paid for an experience as well as food. Yet we had neither for the last course.  We took the dessert and left. On the tube home my husband opened it and it was some ratty looking piece of chocolate tart. Not the strawberry cheesecake that everyone else had and we were expecting. So not only were we not important enough to get our feed with the rest. We didn’t even get the dessert we paid for.  We did not get what we had paid for at all. In fact we were left feeling like we not only didn’t matter but just were not important.
166,"Visited recently for a friends 40th birthday. Cabaret was so-so.. full of hen do’s. Bar prices extortionate, very rude and unhelpful bar staff. Waiter was great - but in general one word for this experience - avoid."
167,"London Cabaret Club's Hats, Heels and Horses show gives the illusion of glamour and class, but is ultimately a joyless affair that is not even as good as what you might expect to see in Benidorm. It could have beed a great night, but something just felt a bit off throughout. The show was often directed to one end of the promenade stage (the VIP's), or you would have a singer standing in the corner blocking your view of an act, which is fine if you like watching peoples backs. You also can't help think that whoever directed the show, believes that having live singers hack their way through some awful song through each act adds a level of sophistication to the evening... but it doesn't. It just makes it feel cheesy and and a bit cringe. I just yearned for some levity. But it was all very earnest. Lots of dancing (not really my thing), which once I'd seen one routine I felt like I'd seen them all. You bet on a video of a horse race, which felt very working men's club. A pole dance, some nice costumes but nothing I could get excited about. If like us you managed to get a discounted ticket, still be prepared to pay through the nose once there. A single bottle of their cheapest white wine will set you back £40. There are so many cabaret options in and around London, that are a fraction of the price, that I honestly could not think of a single reason to recoment The London Cabaret Club over them."
168,"I booked tickets to ""Hats, Heels and Horses"" on the spur of the moment for a friend's birthday, which turned into a great night out. We arrived quite after work at 18:40 for the half-price happy hour cocktails (until 19:00), which were good. The hotel style lounge bar is really nice and there were singers from the outset, all of whom were very talented.  We then moved into the ballroom for the show which was really good, it's mostly choreographed dancing, high energy and well executed. There were numerous costume changes and live singing throughout. I would definitely say the show has high production values and you get a lot of show for your money. There were also 3 acrobatic performers the pole performer, in particular, was very impressive.  The service was really good from start to finish, everyone was exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to ensure we and other guests had a good evening. The maître d' at reception asked my friend if it was a special occasion when she arrived and as a result, came out during the show with fire sparklers and a complimentary dessert which was nice.  We ordered a cheese board and a charcuterie board which were both okay, although the quality of the produce could have been better and the portion a touch larger. But generally, they were good to nibble on. All the drinks we had including cocktails, prosecco, and wine were pretty good.  After the show, the lounge turns into a fun small club with 2 DJ's. The DJ's were really good and really made the lounge area fun. We probably would have stayed longer if the cocktails were cheaper (outside of happy hour cocktails cost £15 + 15% service).  Overall it was an enjoyable night, my friends expressed that they'd really enjoyed the cabaret and we moved on to some other bars and a club.  ****** I will note for full disclosure that I got the show tickets for £4 each, and 25% off our total bill with Dineclub membership. If I'd paid full price I'd probably knock a star off on the value front ******"
169,"I took my wife to see the latest show ""Hats, Heels and Horses."" She enjoyed it more than she expected and commented how professional the cabaret was. A special highlight was the singing and dancing of star performer Vladimir Kozevnikov. The audience was well-dressed and included a wide range of age-groups. You could feel that everyone was having a good night out."
170,"Went for my partners 30th, the night was superb excellent show and food was very nice. The diamond package was worth it staff can’t do enough to make you feel like a VIP. Would definitely return and the night after the show is just as good really good choice of music and the Dj’s were fabulous"
171,"Visited with my husband , voucher received as a gift and we were not sure of to expect. We were pleasantly surprised, venue was great and we certainly enjoyed the evening. stunning costumes and a variety of music and dance. a visit. Would recommend. Drinks are pricey but it is London but having paid £80.00 for a bottle of champagne in Mayfair a few nights before we were slightly surprised at the cost here being £110 plus additional 12% service charge for V. Cliquot. Coctails and bar drinks as expected. did not eat here but saw the cheese and biscuits on the next table which looked good. Once the show is finished we were ushered back into the bar area and enjoyed the music and dancing."
172,"Great all round night on the town in the centre of town . Drinks, dinner, music and entertainment with dancing. Located in a Beautiful iconic Art Deco building with many stunning original quality design features. We arrived at the grand entrance and glided down a beautifully Wood panelled staircase to a cosy comfortable cocktail lounge bar. Welcoming service with drinks to match. Prices are a bit toppy but worth it. We were then escorted to our comfortable booth table in the very impressive glamorous deco ballroom. A great buzz and atmosphere with prompt efficient table service. We had Champagne and canapés on arrival soon followed by staters of scallops ceviche and asparagus with poached egg. Very tasty maybe could do with more choice. We then ordered wine for the rest of the meal. For main course we had well prepared and perfectly cooked sea bass and I had a beautiful cut of lamb with sides. Then came some very tasty deserts or fresh fruit. Wine top ups could be more frequent, we could have managed 2 bottles. The entertainment show throughout the evening was Fantastique! Great dancing, singing with wonderful costumes. All staff and performers seem to enjoy giving guests a great night out. We will return"
173,"Cracking entertaining stage show full of variety, wonderful dancing, singing and stunning costumes. The cyr wheel and the juggler were cool. Staff were super friendly and attentive and the food was really tasty. Will be back."
174,"Very nice venue, good service, highly entertaining show full of magic, elegance and charm. Recommended!"
175,I was very impressed with the show!! I enjoyed every dance and performance. It is a must-see show. Thank you to the staff too
176,I was worried after readying the reviews but it turned out to be a great night.  Entertainment was great a real mix and something for everyone. Don’t go expecting too much and u will not be disappointed. Staff were helpful and the food was nice although publishing the menu before hand would be good.  We had a free bottle of wine .... what a nice surprise.  Place was lovely and decor was very 1920’s.  Worth a visit is you are looking for something different to do instead of a London show.  Dress up guys and enjoy
177,I was expecting the worst after reading the reviews on here but it was actually good fun and I would definitely return.  The food was good (although we didn’t know the menu before the night). Portions are on the smaller side so don’t starve yourself before you go but it all tasted good and was a nice light meal.  The entertainment was great! The only reason I can think of for the bad reviews is that people’s expectations are unrealistic - It isn’t a west end musical and it isn’t Vegas but it was full of energy and very entertaining to watch.  All in all a good night out which I would happily do again.
178,"I hate writing bad reviews, but please do not bother, save yourself time and money, as I was left disappointed and embarrassed.  I wished I listened to other 1 star ratings on here, instead, I fell for the 5-star reviews that are now suspiciously too good. I purchased 7x tickets to the “Royal Ascot” show for my aunties Hen Do.  So why was I was left disappointed and embarrassed?  1. The choreography was BASIC and don’t expect a cabaret....break dancing? Basic level pole dancing, classical Indian theme dancing? I honestly did not get it at all.  2. A dog? We watched a dog be brought up on stage, at first we found it funny but then quickly realised it was very random, the dog was being bribed with treats and did not listen! They tried doing a few basic tricks such as manoeuvring the dog under a leg which failed.  3. Waiters have no knowledge of what they are selling. (my mum enquired about a drinks package when at the venue, and the waitress had no idea how it worked).  4. RUDE staff, our waitress had an attitude, we tried getting her attention for around 10 minutes to pay, she shot back with an excuse “I was waiting for the show to end” when we clearly saw she was laughing and chit-chatting with her colleague, which is fine we get it, we’re not robots, but the comment honestly shocked us. And just to be clear, it says “table service available throughout the show”.  5. Alcohol is excessively overpriced.  6. We arrived at 8:30 pm (when the show starts), by 8:50 pm everyone disappeared off stage, no warning given, and not until 9:30 pm the “show” continued. Another 30 minutes break followed, without any entertainment during this. Just loud music blasting out.  7. This really topped it all off for us, the half-filled hall left before the show ended. Again, I am no professional show organiser but the entire “VIP section” was empty, the whole performance was in the direction of the VIP area, so we pretty much saw the back of peoples heads the whole night.  As a manager, I would have seen the number of tickets sold and known the room will be half empty and strategically placed people in the best possible positions to ensure a maximum level of satisfaction is achieved from all guests and to gain a good reputation! They would have lost no money by doing this.  If it was not my aunties Hen Do, half of us would if walked out not even 30 minutes into the show."
179,"Cheap bought in boil in bag food, crap wine, bad attitude from under developed staff. Don’t just don’t."
180,"Absolutely brilliant evening spent at The Cabaret Club with the The Great Gatsby. Entertained fantastically, the acts were all brilliant. Highly recommended."
181,"We booked for the All About Gatsby with Love Dinner Show on Valentine’s night. We paid for the Gold tickets which included champagne on arrival. The tickets said doors open at 6.30pm and we would be shown to our seats at 8pm, so we arrived just before 8pm. They were very busy. No sign of the champagne so I queued at the bar. Champagne was not sold by the glass, so I had to buy a bottle. We sat down on some free seats and were promptly moved as our Gold tickets did not include the ability to sit down in the bar! The manager’s excuses about the champagne were bad... it would be at our table when we got into the ballroom. What were we expected to drink now? He asked what I wanted and I said he could remove the bottle on our table and refund me for the bottle we had bought at the bar. He was quibbling over the difference on price of standard champagne v Rose Champagne. When they sold it for £138 a bottle I found it pathetic for him to argue. We eventually got to our seats at 9pm and found our champagne was not on our table. The manager had not agreed to the Champagne swap! The manager with some more persuasion did swap the standard champagne for Rose Champagne, but was a bit direct about asking if we were now happy. He could have done with some customer service skills.  The tables were crammed in and we had literally zero elbow room until the couple at the next table left. Our table was on a raised area and my girlfriend was so close to the edge I feared her chair may fall off. The show started almost immediately and the entertainers were good and put on an enjoyable show, even if some of the numbers were a little modern for a Gatsby era show.  The big let down was the food. Our main course did not arrive until 11.45 and was over cooked tasteless chicken that had probably been cooked a couple of hours ago and was now cold. The music was loud (OK) but the bass speaker made our table vibrate so much that all the cutlery fell off as well as the ice bucket with the champagne bottle.  Despite the awful food and the arrogant manager we still enjoyed this overpriced evening. Don’t worry about how much it is costing, or getting a good meal; just enjoy the show and imagine you have been transported to a 1920s Chicago speakeasy."
182,"This event was really good fun. They encourage you to arrive at 12 for a 1pm start. We got there early and queued to get in. Probably best to arrive at 12.15, to allow time for the queue to clear. Pastries arrived from 12 but we had to chase for ours. One of the hosts encouraged us to buy a bottle (between the 5 of us)... beware, the prices are not inclusive of the 15% service charge! However, the bottomless brunch was served from 1pm with the entertainment and we had plenty of prosecco served to us. One cocktail (Archers based, I would say...). We didn't feel we had to buy another drink after the brunch. Food wasn't brilliant, not terrible either, but it served to soak up the alcohol! The entertainment was really 3 acts, a compere who performs too and a troupe of dancers. Good range of songs, plenty of encouragement to join in and to dance, but only if you wanted to, some of us stayed seated the whole time. There is just under an hour of cheesy disco/showtunes disco after the show finished, so it goes on from 1pm to 5pm. We all had a great time, I would recommend this to anyone who loves the idea of a singalong Mamma Mia..."
183,"This is a massively overpriced event. The quality of food is incredibly poor, dishes are bland and cold and they come with a large price tag. Drinks are equally expensive.  You’d hope the performance part would make up for it... sadly not. The acts feels tired and the performers uninterested, some are downright talentless. A few men (not in the fittest condition I’ll be honest) perform forgettable routines whilst beautiful and more talented women act as a moving background most of the time.  There are dozens of cabaret performance venues around London, go to one of these instead if you want to see a truly good show, and save yourself a fortune!"
184,I only write bad reviews when something is really bad and this is one of those occasions. I had to apply one star to submit the rating but I would have put none of that had been an option.  I’m here at the London Cabaret Club for a musical themed brunch event. We are a party of seven. We had two tables allocated to us split between levels (bad planning as there are plenty of smaller groups) and now our other table has been given to another party! The staffs solution to this was to cram an extra tiny table and two chairs so we are currently crammed in a corner in a health and safety seating nightmare. We booked 2 months ago!!  I am beyond livid the so much so it’s ruined the event and I’m posting this review before the brunch has even started.  To add insult to injury the ‘bottomless’ brunch so far consists 3 Danish pastries - this is for seven already livid people AND you have to go to the bar to get the bottomless Prosecco and cocktails - the queue obscures the view of the poor souls sat around the stage.  Has his company ever hosted an event before and if they have they seriously need to re-train whoever planned the seating!  I just want to be refunded and go home to be honest. Absolutely disgusted!!
185,"I came here for a friends birthday and as all pretentious London club's do, they charged the men £25 each, whilst the ladies were admitted for free.  As it was my friend's birthday, we had an agreement where we'd be provided with a table and free bottle of champagne. We weren't even admitted into the function room where the cabarat takes place, so up until midnight, we were the only ones in the lounge. I have no idea what we paid £25 for, since there was no atmosphere what so ever. Our table was no more than a low coffee table with a couple of loungers around it.  The drinks are ridiculously overpriced. When I ordered a bottle of house wine, the bartender decided to give me a £50 bottle. When I asked for one of the cheaper bottles instead, it came to £45. Apparently 15% service is included in all drinks. Rather than telling me this politely, the bartender handed me my card back and shouted ""I don't have time for this!"".  I later ordered another bottle through a different bartender. At this point, the one who had spoken to me rudely then went over to him and whispered something in his ear. At this point I was outraged by how unprofessional the staff were. Perhaps I wasn't rich enough for their liking!  The club itself was nothing special. Most visitors were tourists or wealthy middle aged men with younger girls. In all, it wasn't a very enjoyable night."
186,"Had a wonderful evenings entertainment. The food was well prepared, though we could have done with a little more.  The ambience and atmosphere was wonderful and the artists’ performances was excellent.  A big thank you to Dean and the rest of the staff who looked after us so well and made us feel as if we were the only people in the place,  Can’t wait for next time!"
187,"This is a really fun night, and all things considered, they do a good job.  There is a lovely deco-themed lounge that opens at 6:30pm. There is a cloak room for £2 item. Drinks are on special until 8pm. (Seating for dinner isn't until 8:30ish.) Cocktail list is extensive and fun, and come in lovely cut-crystal glassware.  We did the dinner & show ticket. We were really hungry as food didnt start until 9pm. Starters were decent, but the main vegetarian course (risotto) was like a bowl of bland soupy rice. I didn't eat more than 3 bites of it. Dessert was cheesecake and good.  There are performances throughout the night, and not a bad table in the house. If you just get the ""show"" ticket, you will be on unreserved tall stools in the back, so probably better to get a reserved spot.  There was a lot of great dancing, some arial acts, and a seriously impressive magician. There were also some drunken hen parties adding to the entertainment- it was impressive how the staff kept them from disrupting things.  Afterward, there was a dj in the lounge to keep the party going.  Despite the terrible main course, I still thought it was a really fun night out."
188,"A wonderful venue with such a classy feel. Everything was perfect from the bar to the seating, the waiter, the food, and most importantly, the amazing and talented entertainment! We really enjoyed every minute!"
189,"The experience was a mix of good and very poor. I think very few of the staff are particularly experienced or professional The Dodd was very mixed, good and tasty to very dry Service very from doing their best to couldn’t care less Good show but the rest....oops"
190,We booked our company party here for the Gatsby Christmas show. There were 14 of us and we all really enjoyed the evening. The show was amazing and we felt very close to the action. All of the performers were great. The staff were also very accommodating and looked after our group throughout the show. The food was a bit disappointing as seemed rushed and wasn't great quality but we felt that the show and experience in general made up for this. We would definitely return for another show :)
191,"The show is absolutely amazing, best I’ve seen in a long time. The waiters were friendly and the food was good. If I had a complaint it’s that there was no seating left in the reception, so best arrive early if you want a seat at the bar."
192,One of the best nights out I’ve had in London for a long time! We wanted to try something new and the London cabaret club was definitely worth the extra money compared with just going out for a normal dinner. The show was amazing and the food delicious. I recommend to anyone wanting to spice up their outings!
193,"Love this place and couldn’t believe i hadn’t been sooner! The show was extraordinary and extremely entertaining with singers dancers tap Aerialists magicians etc. Opting for the Diamond Tickets we started with canapés and champagne and then had a delicious 4 course meal during the show. The cocktails were great and our waiter was very friendly and helped us have a really good time. I would definitely recommend, it’s very unique for London and we will be back in the new year!"
194,The London Cabaret Club Bloomsbury gave me a fantastic evening. I was celebrating my birthday with nine guests. From the moment I first steped into The London Cabaret Club Bloomsbury I felt the ambience and knew the place was amazing. The staff treat you as special.  The waiters were extra attentive they all were so helpful. The atmosphere was captivating and surroundings splendid.  The service was outstanding. The dinner was included so delicious very superb.
195,"£125 per head for cruise-meets-butlins ‘show’ with school dinner thrown in. Terrible service - waited hours for the awful food and dreadful wine, with no apologies. Staff so disorganised that we had to laugh! Comedy awful. Don’t go!"
196,"Horrendous in every way. Show - sexist, poorly performed, banal, cliched and unimaginative. Food was literally worse than school dinners I had in the 80s, plus it took forever. Service - beyond atrocious. Rude, grumpy, slow and quite simply inept. I honestly haven’t been treated that badly anywhere, ever. We waited 1.5 hours for the wine that was free with our meal. And all this for the astonishing price of £125! What an incredible rip off. Don’t waste your time or money in this soulless joyless hellhole."
197,"55 only for the show, unfortunately I only could book with dinner for 125 and this was not ok, time between the gigs was much to long as same as time between the courses, show was mediocre, bad choreography, bad organisation of all activities, the owner should visit the Moulin Rouge in Paris to learn how it works"
198,"Christmas party for 80. Absolutely superb evening, excellent service and sublime entertainment! Can’t recommend it enough, professional and extremely well organised."
199,The acts were brilliant and staff very pleasant and helpful. Long wait from starter to main course but had the entertainment to occupy our minds! Drinks are very dear but went to the Happy hour first!overall a very enjoyable experience.
200,"I was here on a Saturday night in July 2018. There was 4 of us, and we had booked the VIP package for 'Queen of roses'. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a host who took us to the lounge. We ordered some cocktails and canapes, which were really nice. We were then taken into the main area and seated next to the stage. The show was okay, not the best one I've seen but absolutely okay. The food was average. We didn't know that they were going to charge us for water (as we had paid for the whole package in advance), so my advise would be to ask for tap water to avoid this. The bottled water is £5/bottle. Or maybe the Cabaret Club should include this in their packages."
201,"We prebooked the VIP dinner package for the queen of roses show and weren't really sure what to expect but wow what a night, you get escorted to your private table in the 30's style lounge with live entertaining, canapés and cocktails, then escorted to your table in the ballroom for your 5 course dinner which takes place during the show, the only way to describe it is a fantastic west end show, mixed with dance, music, magic burlesque and the bizarre which because you are so close you almost feel a part of it. The cast intermingle with the auduiance and after 2 1/2 hours of pure enjoyment you then get escorted back again to your private table in the lounge for the disco and agin joined by the cast. Oh and great service thrown in. An absolute must for an adults night out"
202,"This Cabaret Club is outstanding, from the moment you arrive you are led through a beautifully decorated hallway into a gorgeous bar area and then into an amazing dining room. The stage is in the middle with tables laid out around it, rising up in tiers. The lighting and decor produce a truly cabaret atmosphere and great music was being played by a trio of lovely ladies on electric fiddles. We had the VIP treat and from the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful and service was impeccable. The food was first class and the Queen of Roses show was extraordinary. The costumes and dancers were wonderful and the individual artists and acts were all very professional and entertaining producing a polished first class show. It was fast moving with difference acts changing over with seamless ease, a product of a well produced show. We were a party of 4 and would not hesitate to recommend this as one of the best nights out London has to offer. Do not miss the opportunity to go to this London Cabaret Club as its great value for money and one of the best experiences we have ever had. Well done to the organiser, you know how to give everyone a thrilling night of entertainment as well as a great dining experience."
203,"We were a party of 4 and treated ourselves to the VIP tickets. I recommend this Cabaret evening to all... we were a family party of 30 year olds to me ,mid 70s.and all enjoyed the evening immensely . The venue is excellent, the food was really good and the cabaret spectacular.The dancers , male and female were great , clearly enjoying themselves. The singers were equally good as were the musicians. In our VIP seats we were within say 2 meters of the stage ... treat yourself to being this close to the show. As well as the musicians, dancers and singers there were 5 speciality acts... an excellent magician, exciting drummers, and an equally good guitarist. My favourites were an extremely athletic young man doing amazing things on a giant hoop and a young girl aerialist . For a completely different evening out, go ! Highly recommended."
204,"I dont really write reviews but guys the waitress who serve your drink/meal will RUIN your experience. Seriously, during the show, she was literally begging for the drinks. Oh hell yeah very aggressive, and at certain point, we ended up distracted from the show. Worst experience ever. I would say dancers and the plot of the show was well organised. So I will recommend for only shows but waitress, VERY VERY DISTURBING. Don’t go for dinner here if you are not buying drinks."
205,"I attended the London Cabaret Club last weekend to see their new show Queen of Roses and recommend strongly the place.  The shows are outstanding, the staff and performers are very welcoming and here from start to the end to make you have a great time. Looking forward to the next shows.  I strongly recommend the place."
206,"Went with a bunch of mates of mine, had a splendid time. Drinks & food were good, but the shows won it for me. Some amazing acts. Planning my next visit with my other half soon, Vip tables are the best.. Great location!"
207,"I booked the Cabaret Club for their Queens of Roses show for my fiancee's birthday and had an absolutely amazing time. Having lived in London for 10 years, this was easily one of the best night outs we've ever had. The entertainment was incredible and hugely surpassed my expectations. We were well looked after and there wasn't a dull moment in the show, from pre-entertainment to the post-party. The food was great, and my fiancee was surprised with a birthday dessert treat as well. Highly recommended! A huge thanks to our waiter Jonas for some added entertainment"
208,"Was a fun night. The entertainment is mixed with talented dancers, musicians and singers. Jonas the waiter was absolutely fantastic all night."
209,"I went to the lido in Paris (topless dancers abound) with my grandparents when I was 14 and that was less awkward than this entire experience. Firstly, the show production is of panto quality. The costumes are terrible, staging awkward and if you’re in the wrong seat you pretty much just see the backs of the cast. Secondly, we ordered 2 cheese boards and it took them 2.5 hours for them to arrive at our table. And we were overcharged. I didn’t know that cutting cheese and putting crackers on a board took such finesse (!!!) THEN they had a big show of giving out free birthday puddings to everyone in the audience. Much to our surprise, our friend, whose birthday it was (which we had told all our wait staff about too) did NOT receive a cake. At this point all we could do was laugh. All of us have worked in service and would’ve been fired on the spot had this had happened on our shift. Don’t waste your time, spend the extra on a Eurostar and go to the Lido with your grandparents instead."
210,"Intriguing club, interesting and unusual acts, very well presented and tasty food! Surprising combination of charcuterie and sultanas infused in balsamic reduction,absolutely delicious!"
211,"Truly fantastic performances from every single cast member of the show, support staff also played their part in making the night memorable for our 30th anniversary.  Maybe the only negative for us, was that the venue is proving too popular & due to our table being squeezed too close to others, my wife had a drink knocked over her back from another group, but to be fair the staff were round quickly to clean up, offer to pay for dry cleaning, move us to a different table with a couple of complimentary proseccos.  All said & done, we would love to visit again to see another show."
212,"The venue is a few minutes North of Holborn tube station. There is a bar area before you move into their very luxurious ballroom with cosy seats and tables around the stage which was in the centre. For the show you have dancers, singers, acrobats, magician , live band. Drinks can be pricey so it's a kind of 'special occasion' evening. To be expected as it's a cabaret club rather than a pub. We had a good time over the hours we were here."
213,"We arrived at 18:30 to take advantage of the one hour half price drinks offer! Fantastic we thought, until we were sat there till 21:00 before we were seated. So the money we saved on the half price cocktails was soon spent having drinks while waiting to be seated. The price for a cocktails rage from £13, but the surroundings make it worth it. A modern day cabaret venue.  The show itself was visually stunning but a little confusing. this didn't matter though as all the performers clearly put 110% into the show.  The food was also very nice. Not to much that you were left feeling full.  it was a shame the drinks prices were so high as we would have stayed later for the disco part of the night, we just felt we couldn't justify the price of the drinks.  An amazing night was had by all of my group, the only thing which marked this venue down was the price of the drinks."
214,"My husband and I had a wonderful night here celebrating our wedding anniversary. The entertainment was fabulous! We didn’t eat here so cannot really comment although some people were being served their main course at 10pm and this does seem very late to be eating. The drink prices at the venue are unjustifiably astronomically extortionate, which is a downside!"
215,"Outstanding performance, amazing service and quality food, totally recommend it!!! Beautiful atmosphere...the best cabaret shoe in London"
216,Never been to a cabaret and did not know what to expect but will highly recommend anyone to go. the venue was really classy and waiting staff were very friendly. Myself and a friend booked tickets in advanced for £20 each. We were seated on the raised platform to the side and had a clear view of all the performers. The show lasted around 2 hours and there was intermissions to allow people to go for breaks.
217,"As soon as we walked in through the door we knew this was going to be a great experience. We were greeted by friendly and helpful staff and were escorted downstairs to the bar area. The atmosphere was fantastic with live music in a stunning room. As expected the drinks were very expensive, although the bar service was pretty good, even in the packed bar area. We were then escorted to our table in the main stage area to dine and enjoy the show. What a show! We weren’t sure what to expect with the title of Queen of Roses but with dancers, singers, acrobats, magician and live band the whole night was really entertaining and seamlessly produced - absolutely stunning throughout. The food was good for the price and the table service was very good, although as before, the drinks are expensive. Altogether a fantastic night and will definitely be returning later in the year for the next series of shows."
218,"A good night out, the show was very good and the venue was well presented, the hostesses were all friendly and pleasant, but the waiters service were not to stantard ,drinks are to the pricey side and the service doesnt meet the expectations for what you pay for drinks and food, but other than that the perfomers were amazing. A good night out."
219,"I went to see the Cabaret performance Queen of Hearts and I have to say, it was the most thrilling, entertaining night out of the year. Absolutely incredible evening. As well as the food, the cocktails are brought to your table too. The dancers and singers and performers are just so incredibly talented and professional, I actually went twice I loved it so much. Highly recommend."
220,"The whole night from start to finish was seemless. The service/drinks/entertainment/food - perfect way to spend the weekend. High quality, fast paced showstopping entertainment! The food was great for the price too - lots of flavour, leaving me wanting more. I will be returning on a special occasion for sure"
221,Amazing time! Wonderful evening experience mixed with some awesome performances. Particularly attentive staff so as good a service as I could ask for. Place looked classy and i will certainly be coming again.
222,"Our first visit, Fantastic night out. Amazing cocktails, fantastic food, great performers, we had such a good time. A special thanks to Johnathan who made our night very special,Thank you, you are absolutely amazing we will come back."
223,"Firstly let me say I got free tickets to the Queen of Hearts cabaret show so didn't have the £55 ticket only cost - which tbh thank the lord as I would be very cross if I had spent that for this evening. It started oddly as an evening when we were shown to the cloakroom and barked at by the attendant who seemed to think despite there being no queue and no one but us handing in coats that she had to get rid of us as fast as possible and dispense with any niceties. Then we walked to the bar along a very thin corridor that had seating alongside fake palm trees and low level glass tables - honestly its an accident waiting to happen. We then arrived into the weirdest bar I have ever seen where some tables and chairs were almost right up the bar which also had barstools at it making it nigh on impossible to get to the bar - we love a challenge so did manage to get there, where it got even weirder with the bar staff. Drinks are not cheap - cocktails around £14 so you expect not to be treated like criminals and maybe this should have indicated the type of place it was. My friend ordered 3 drinks and called over to take one away that was ready. The bar man tried to stop him as we hadn't yet paid! Yet my friend was still there ordering the other drinks - weird and rude. The bar had a big screen that was showing Eurovision - in hindsight we should have just stayed and watched that! But it did mean even more congestion around the bar. Eventually we were called into the ballroom which rather than letting us in the nearest entrance we had to go back down the weird corridor and into the ballroom. We had a reasonable sized table with lots of glasses on it - again a disaster waiting to happen and happen it did as glasses broke. The show eventually started and what can I say - it was at best amateur and akin to something you may see on a cruise ship or at Butlins. That said the highlight was the acrobatic stars Dennis and Tatiana from Russia - amazing skill and gymnastics. The theme if I can call it that was Queens through the ages and bizarrely we got to see Queen Elizabeth I stripping down to her pants and doing some odd burlesque style which was a little strange! Then onto Queen Victoria who appeared to be more joyous than most of us remember and so much so had the 4 countries of the UK dancing, we were treated to sexy morris dancers, Drummers in kilts and despite the potato famine the Irish dancing up a storm!! Long live the Queen - gawd bless ya! We finished with the present queen who was serenaded by prince Philip with some somewhat bizarre modern R&B. The good bit the host and the Russians -the bad everything else. So in summary it was funny not in a good way and we were glad we hadn't paid for tickets and would be very peeved if I had. Definitely not worth £55 you see better cabaret at any free drag show in Soho!"
224,"My husband and I attended one of the previews for their new show “Queen of Roses.” We weren’t quite sure what to expect, but were definitely impressed! The singers, dancers and costumes were incredible (especially the main blonde singer, Hannah/Anna?) and the music kept it modern and energetic. We went for the VIP 5 course menu which was tasty and included a surprise cocktail half way through. The waiting staff were all very friendly and the manager Jonathan did a great job of greeting and chatting to many guests personally. A great way to spend an evening and we’ll definitely be back in the future!"
