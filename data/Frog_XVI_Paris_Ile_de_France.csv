9,Affordable pub near the Eiffel tower. Goid draft beers and finger food. Go there and enjoy Shoutout to Jason and Aubrey best barman/women ! Cheers
10,"Small but pleasant, the staff had been charming and the location on one of the most beautiful avenue of Paris"
11,Great burgers and fries!!! Also a very relaxing kinda retro venue. Easy spot for lunch and huge windows to take in the scenery while you eat. English is spoken here for those that wonder. Our service and food were excellent.
12,"Me and my partner had just visited the Eiffel Tower and decided to find a restaurant nearby.  I searched TripAdvisor as i did not want to go to a ‚Äútourist restaurant‚Äù aka overpriced and poorly cooked establishment.  Upon searching TripAdvisor we came across this restaurant which immediately took my fancy.  I went to its website and tried to book a table but it showed fully booked until 4th January 2023.  As we were nearby me and my partner decided to go anywhere and Im glad we did.  Seats were available and plentiful!  We sat down and we immediately saw other customers food and got even more excited. We ordered an entree of chicken wings and these were - Magnifique!  We also ordered a traditional bacon cheeseburger and fries and this did not disappoint.  The burger was tender and really juicy.  The home made lemonade followed and a Coca Cola in its original bottle. The restaurant is a brewery so also had a good variety of Ales and beer.  Once we finished our food we decided to order a dessert, as the food blew us away. The Churros and Waffles were .  This is a must when in Paris!"
13,"Thank you very much Lucy and Kenan ! Best waitress, end best bar in town ! Everything is made to spend a very good night with a great dinner ans great beer !!!!!"
14,"Thanks to Natssatasia and Lucy, we had a great evening. Amazing food and drinks. Very good service and vive. Please more G-Eazy songs !"
15,"Visited earlier this year, ordered a vegan dish and was bought out a meat dish instead. Was then advised that they didn‚Äôt have the vegan dish which is why they bought the meat one out - this should NEVER happen. We ordered some thing else instead, this meant that we had to eat at completely different times as my food was already on the table.  The bill then came, and we were charged for the original dish AND the dish that we ordered as a replacement! The staff were extremely rude and reluctant to help us remove it from our bill, no sorry at all.  I really don‚Äôt understand how this place is so highly rated."
16,"I mean it was OK, very young American. They didn't have our reservation, so husband's allergy info wasn't known and, even after careful description and even providing written information, the allergy wasn't addressed. My chicken burger was fine."
17,"Food was decent, the wait staff pretty good. Just don't expect any awareness of allergies. I provided a written list of my allergy (one thing really) and the kitchen screwed it up with cross contamination on the first try. They redid the meal, which was fine. Just be careful. And if you are allergic to dogs, remember that this Paris and pet dogs are allowed (apparently) in food establishments - let the coughing and sneezing begin."
18,As bar food goes you‚Äôll find the burger and fries here hard to beat. The venue worked well for an informal work night-out and a good selection of beers too.
19,Great atmosphere and super service !! Special thanks to Harshit !! He is very kind ! Excellent pub for an afterwork beer !
20,"This place has a lot of visitors, i have been going through it for a while and finally decided to visit. Tasty beer, good service and fine food options. Will come back for sure to watch a match.  Personally want to thank waiter Ferdinand for advise to order burger with double cheese and welcoming behavior."
21,"My first time visiting this place, type of food- us fast food, they have their own production of deers, I was quite impressed. The waiter Ferdinand served me like I would‚Äôve given him 100% tips. This place is good for visiting with friends for football match. Recommend"
22,It was our first Paris night and we had magnificient time thanks to Frog XVI and Ferdinand. Thank you Frog XVI and Ferdinand!
23,"Me and my friends were country hopping for the World Cup and wanted to watch a few footy games while in Paris. Found this bar and loved the atmosphere so stayed for two full games! Awesome drinks, awesome food and our waitress Aubrey was absolutely tremendous. Fantastic personality and recommended the best food and drinks to get as we had trouble reading the menu. Five stars all around"
24,"Great vibes, great service Aubrey was great and showed us where to visit during our trip in Paris. This is our first day in Paris and it was very helpful."
25,"We had a great time which started as finding somewhere to shelter from the rain, to 4 hours later staying for dinner and more drinks! A lovely greeting from a lady who we think was the manager - very knowledgeable. Aubrey was great from start to finish! Super friendly and helpful! Can‚Äôt fault her service, thank you Aubrey! Food was a good standard - we just went for a mix from the snack selection. Good choice of drinks and a lovely atmosphere."
26,"Great place, I love coming here. The food is tasty fast food type: burgers and very tasty tacos, goes very well with the beer they produce themselves. They also have insanely delicious non-alcoholic cocktails. Dogs are always welcome, nice waiters even bring water for the dogs. My evening was brightened up by the waiter Ferdinand led by the manager Nadyr, very kind and welcoming service. If you are near the Eiffel Tower and want a quick and tasty meal, this is the place for you."
27,"Service de Ferdi üëçso good. Incredible place with great food and waiters. Wi¬¥l come back for sure. The place is near Effel Touwer, shoving football"
28,"Came here after walking by. Was met by Lucy who gave us a table, let us sample beer, was basically awesome. Would come back here just based Lucy. Place also has awesome beer."
29,"Very chill and good atmosphere. A pub with a good crowd and a French twist Lola our waitress was sooooo kind and funny. Made our experience even better. Thanks Lola, you rock"
30,"Fantastic food, at least the burger we had. Well fried, good meat and a nice balance with accessories.  We drank several beers as well and their own selection is good. incredibly tasty. The price level is on a par with many in Paris. It quickly becomes ‚Ç¨50-60 for two people with food and drink. Recommended for some American / TexMex food and delicious beer.  The Staff also speak english very vel. Not very common in Paris, so thats a huge pluss in my book."
31,It was very good food. I love it and very nice. A nice pub with lots of youths and great atmosphere. A place to visit if you love some noise.
32,"Many a man searches for the one place that can offer him dope music, food and drinks for delightful moments between friends. You will not be disappointed here for the Frog manages to reunite this holy trinity. Plus service meets the expectations for this nice place, shootout to Aubrey who saved me from starvation and made this evening at the Frog a lot better."
33,We had spent a total of 3 nights in Paris and were ready for a little back home dinner and this place was great. Good happy hour deal and Aubrey took care of us with helping us out on some great selections. Ask for her if you‚Äôre English speaking and want that back home service!
34,I was at Frog 16 and it was a great experience. My smash burger was awesome. It‚Äôs a great place to spend time with friends. Special thanks to Nastassia for her advices to visit in Paris and her professional work. I will definitely come here when I am back to Paris
35,"Came here for a change in Paris as we didn't fancy traditional French style food/dining. The atmosphere in the pub was great, and our waitress was really friendly and attentive even though she had lost her voice! She had green/turquoise hair. They do pitchers of beer which are decent value for Paris, and they have a good selection of beers on tap.  We ordered some wings, nachos, quesadillas and mozzarella sticks which were all really tasty.  Would recommend coming here for a change from the traditional French cafes!"
36,"Great service, great location & fun atmosphere! Aubrey & staff were welcoming and knowledgeable about the area. We will be back"
37,I visited Frog Restaurant while on vacation in Paris. I enjoyed it so much I went back twice. On the first visit my server was Cameron and on the second visit my server was Aubrey. Both servers were great!!  The food was good and Cameron and Aubrey made the visit even better. I recommend this place if you come to Paris.
38,We loved our time at frog ! Aubrey was an amazing waitress ! We are definitely coming back sometime soon
39,"Interesting, eclectic choice of menu items with typically charming French cafe outdoor seating! We've been in Europe x5 weeks and I was dying for a good burger and fries -- excellent burger with blue cheese and excellent limes frites (of course!). Hubby had a curry plate that was just delicious! Also, lovely passion fruit caipirinha! Best -- we had the sweetest, most attentive server -- Ollayna, Alaina or Elaina -- was fantastic!!!!"
40,Tonight I‚Äôm hanging out with my friends and we decided to look at a nice bar close to Tour Eiffel and we found one which is Frog XVI it‚Äôs really nice bar. I ordered a wonderful drink. Waitress here are so nice especially the waitress name‚Äôs Gift. She‚Äôs so friendly and tried to talk to me like we are a friend for so long time. If you wanna find a good drink and food with a good environment I recommend you to visit here.
41,"For some reason it is hard to find bars in Europe that have seats at them. I prefer to sit at a bar and speak to the bartenders to get a local feel. These guys/girls were great. Actually got a decent drink there too, which is saying a lot in such a touristic area."
42,Laura was an amazing waitress. She knew how to anticipate out needs and provide them in advance. Great service and great food
43,"One of the best salads i had! And fries also very good‚Ä¶ The staff was really nice, friendly.. No reservation needed, which is great."
44,Can't believe I would ever give 1 star. This Frog should be ashamed for the fish n chips we were served today for an early dinner. The thing was obviously a leftover from lunch and was put back in the fryer. Not only ruined but almost black from the refrying. We were too hungry and short on time to say anything and besides they thought it was good enough to serve. I recommend the Frogs often in my blog but this experience has destroyed a wonderful souvenir. Disappointed to say the least. You guys should have tossed that instead of serving old tainted food. Huge mistake.
45,"My husband and I visited Paris in 2019 and my burger loving husband fell for the Da Vinci Burger. We came back in 2022 JUST for a burger and was not disappointed. Our waiter, Cameron, was amazing. Friendly, patient (we have three children) and so very kind. The beer is great, the drinks are amazing and the food never fails. It's a family favorite and we will hopefully be back."
46,"It was an excellent experience, Aubrey gave us an amazing attention bringing us always a nice smile. We didn't speak french, so our communication in english with her was very helpful... Thanks a million!!!"
47,"Love the bar!!! Excellent service from Aubrey!! Definitely we‚Äôll return. The bar, nice music. good drinks!!!! Love it"
48,Laura was such a nice waitress the food was good and the sweet potatoes are amazing too we will defenetly come back for sure.
49,The beers were 10/10 and Laura the waitress was really nice and caring!!! Thank you very much. The mozzarella sticks were delicious too
50,"Me and my boyfriend visited Frog XVI wanting to find somewhere to watch the football kicking off soon and we were recommended Frog XVI for their Live Sport. Safe to say we were not at all disappointed.  We were greeted by the lovely staff member ‚ÄòSarah‚Äô who was very kind and attentive - our drinks were delivered quickly to our table and she always checked if we were okay and if we needed anything else!  All 3pm kick-offs were shown on TV (which is unusual if you‚Äôre from the UK) so watching all of them in a lovely, cosy bar right next to the Eiffel Tower was absolutely fantastic.  We also had the pleasure of talking to another wonderful staff member ‚ÄòCameron‚Äô who went out of his way to make us feel welcome! He was very friendly and was a pleasure to talk to! Cameron made our time at Frog XVI feel very comfortable and enjoyable!  We also ordered food from here too: chicken wings, nachos and quesadillas - absolutely delicious and really, really reasonably priced considering the area too!  Overall, a lovely afternoon of football, drinks, food and good people (the staff) at Frog XVI! We hope to visit again sometime in the future! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
51,I recently visited this restaurant with my mom. I had the BBQ Burger and my mom ordered the Crunchy Chicken Burger. Both meals were delicious and the craft beers were great as well. Laura was very attentive and kind with great people skills. The overall experience was great. Thanks!
52,"We sat down to grab a drink in the heat and loved the service, Laura was 5*! Drinks are more expensive than most places but you'd expect that as they're all award winning craft beers and taste it to boot. Merci beaucoup!"
53,My brother and I spent a great afternoon watching Premier league. The food was very tasty and our waitress Laura was very friendly and helpful
54,Called into frog XVI during our visit to Paris. I had the fish and chips and my wife had the chicken caesar salad. Both were fantastic. Service was very fast and our waitress Laura was excellent. We both drank the pearl blond beer which was that good we stayed longer than we anticipated probably good it was a short walk to our hotel. I would recommend anyone visiting Paris to pat a visit to frog XV1 a truly fantastic day or evening out.
55,"Pretty Laura was good in service! Thank you very much! Chees burger was really good with sweet potato and kids menu, my child like it!"
56,Great food and great atmosphere!Aubrey was great and such a delight! Fish N Chops was the BEST!!! Would definitely go again!!
57,This was a great place and deserving of its number 3 ranking. The burger was great. Our friends had the fish and chips and it was crispy and not oily. Linda loved the fruity beers.
58,"What a great place!!!! We loved menu,beer and the best was the staff - Aubrey is fabulous!!!! Thank you for exceeding all of our expectations!!"

60,"Had an amazing service today by Laura. She was so helpful, recommended us on what was good, even let us try the different beers they had. To make us more comfortable she spoke to me in English and my boyfriend in Spanish. Great food and staff would definitely recommend ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
61,Had a nice relaxed lunch here. Food was good (although I would have liked my club sandwich toasted) and our waitress Laura was excellent. Try the ginger twist ale which they brew on-site. It‚Äôs delicious
62,"Laura was a super! I really like and good choice of beers. Nice atmoshpere, good location. Cozy interior! I really really like"
63,"We have just had a great meal at Frog XVI , the food was served really quickly , fab cocktails.

Highly recommended , we will definitely return before we leave Paris."
64,Loved the veggie burger and the interesting tasting beers. Our waitress Laura Aldana was so sweet and attentive ! We‚Äôll be back :)
65,"Nachos were ok. Chicken wings were excellent. Had an issue with one of our cocktail glasses but it was solved by the staff. Great if you go in happy hour (before 8pm). We highlight the service of Laura, she was always available and helpful to explain when we had some doubts about the menu. Will come back soon !"
66,Very nice place! Very tasty cocktails! Very tasty cocktails! Very nice service! Specially thanks for Maria üá∫üá¶‚ô•Ô∏è
67,We had a lovely lunch. The service by Cameron was excellent. Very polite and quick. A nice quite terrace in the middle of Paris
68,"Had a very fun night with my friend. Thanks guillaume and Appoline. Nice beer, service and music. We enjoyed it."
69,"Frogs never ceases to disappoint, the food is yummy and the vibes are always good! Aubrey has been my waitress for the summer, so fun and responsive and always has the best recommendations!! 5/5"
70,Vibes were great but Aubrey the bar tender was even better! Yummmm. The Mexican Mule was awesome. I will be back
71,"I came here once when I was a teenager and decided to come back with my girlfriend to see if it was how I remembered more than 5 years later. Needless to say it didn‚Äôt disappoint and my girlfriend had not many expectations as we had just came back from London a few days prior. She loved it and I loved it, exactly how I remembered it. Nastassia was a fantastic waitress and was helpful of what beer to order, and I would highly recommend coming here and trying their Belgium white beer. The chicken wings were different than usual and were also fantastic. The pink spritz and blood orange spritz were a nice variation of the classic spritz."
72,perfect service and delicious food. i cl√© for lunch and enjoyed the services ce if Maria and Beaü´∂üèΩü´∂üèΩü´∂üèΩü´∂üèΩ

75,"Nice atmosphere, great location close to Trocad√©ro! Yummy food (we had nachos and sweet corn balls), friendly staff, lovely bar in the basement!"
76,"Giovanna was our waitress, she couldn‚Äôt have been nicer! It‚Äôs a cozy and relatively calm place in the heart of Paris. Nice choice of beers too!"
77,Good food and service by Bea & Kenan. They were very welcoming and provided some tourist assistance as my mom and I do not speak French.
78,"What a great, unexpected stop in Paris! Not only was the food delicious - you MUST try the tacos - but every worker was exceptionally kind. Our waiter Dan was so attentive and was a joy to be around all night. The bartender Aubrey was kind enough to offer great beer recommendations as well. Definitely worth a stop after taking in the breathtaking sights of the Eiffel Tower!"
79,"I went to the Frog pub before a night out to meet up with some friends and from the word go, I was met with great beers and even better service. Our waiter Dan met us with a cute Irish accent and advised us to get some delicious nachos. He preempted our every move and in the end, we ended up staying much longer than expected thanks to his impeccable service."
80,"He had a really good time in the pub, enjoyed our time there and were really nice served. Thank you for your service and hope to see you soon!"
81,"Marita and Tatiana waitress was perfect, the food deliciousüåû ÊµãÂúü‰∏™‰Ωìverygo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜo‚ÄÜd¬∑ we came for drinks and stayed till the closing"

86,"Came to Paris on a fly in visit from London, we are staying in the area and came accross Frogxvi. The menu stood out as tasty feel good food so we stopped by. We were quickly and attentively served by Henry- also a Brit who spoke excellent English and french. He recommended us on the menu, told us all about their beer and it was a great experience. I know the French aren‚Äôt known for service so this place was a welcome break. Clean, al fesco dining and amazing food!"
87,"Just passed here naturally - had a chicken burger and added bacon. Delicious food, good drinks and friendly and efficient service from our server Henry. Will definitely be coming back!"
88,Not far from the tourist attractions you find this little place. Big pro is the personnel speaks english! Refreshing for people like us who are not native speakers. Thanks for the great service and drinks.
89,"Dropped by on Sunday evening after a long first day in Paris for some well deserved food- we were in for a pleasant surprise at the Frog XVI! The burger (I think it was called the Da Vinci) was delicious and they have a great selection of beers. Also the service was really good, our waitress was Molly and she was really accommodating & helpful, even in the pouring rain!"
90,"Great sweet potato fries and Frogtastic burger went down like a treat with the locally brewed blonde ale. My waiters, Bea and Mariia, were sweet and attentive while refreshingly having none of the Parisian attitudes that you can do without on a Sunday morning."
91,Amazing vibes and impeccable service. Our server Aubrey was always on top of it and incredible accommodating. She needs a promotion!
92,"Dropped by the Frog after walking extensively around Paris during the day with my mates. This charming little pub not far from the Eiffel Tower boasts some of the best customer service you can find in Paris if you don't speak any, or barely any, French. All of the staff were very welcoming and friendly, but I have to say hats off to Dan who served us, as he was so accommodating and was good fun to talk to. Definitely recommend dropping by for a pint or two, and hopefully you get the same level of service I did, maybe you'll be served by Dan too!"

116,Bea was the most amazing waitress ever. She brought out nachos that were so great and I had a great time
117,"Good food. We ate outside at ta table. Good service. Relaxed, casual. I don't like the usual salad dressings in Paris. I am learning to ask for oil and vinegar. The caesar dressing was very thick."

119,"Great service, especially I‚ÄôD like to thank Nastassia, she deserves special attention.

All I can say is how great the staff was including L√©o, the manager on duty, and especially Tatiana G. our personal bartender and server. She was super professional, efficient, 'sympathique', and so accommodating. We feel so lucky that she was the person taking care of our group this evening. I highly recommend FrogXVI for drinks and snacks and a fun time. And look for Tatiana G when you are there."

We sat outside and the young lad working there {sorry don't know your name - you had lived in UK for 3 years and your English was fantastic!} brought us the menu and explained they brew beers on site.

However we stayed awhile and had drinks they were great. I recommend the Porn Star Martini.. The second day we came back and once again Kenneth was our waiter, we had the pulled pork tacos and quesadillas. We enjoyed them both‚Ä¶ he was a great Waitor, fast and friendly"
181,Great beer and great food at very reasonable prices. Bea was sweet and very helpful. She offered great suggestions that helped us enhanced our experience.

186,We were looking for bar restaurant away from the main tourist zone near the Jardins de Trocerdero and came across this gem. We had been in a sister bar called the Frog and Underground in Grands Boulevards so this new find fitted our needs. We were due to celebrate my partners birthday later at a restaurant near our hotel so we ordered the cheese nachos so our evening appetite wasn‚Äôt spoilt. Good choice along with the craft beer too. Staff were very helpful and knowledgable. The beer is brewed on the premises down the stairs in the second bar area.
187,Came here for dinner on Friday night and I had the most incredible experience thanks to my lovely waiter Sonya!! She had the cutest smile which made our dinner and drinks 100 times better! What a wonderful place thank you!

200,"We had an amazing lunch and dinner, it was so much fun we went again , beer is very good, food is ok, the waiters are so good, efficient and friendly. Dianna from Romania was especially so helpful I have to mention they have other nice people working for them too. Kenan the manager was also super nice.  Leo j was also super special. Thanks to him too"
201,"Very nica bar, very good beers! Victoire was very nice üçªüòÅüëç I will be looking forward to go back here when I am back in Paris"
202,Great time thx to a really nice waiter named Martin who took the time to explain the difference between the beers.
203,"First off, let me note that I fully understand the levels of service in some Paris establishments are not what you would normally expect. However, from the moment we walked in and just got pointed to a table we should have realized this wasn‚Äôt going to be good. They have a happy hour special that looked like something to start the evening out with, but we got there about 10 min before that ended. By the time our waitress (same one that pointed us to the table) got to us, even with the place not busy, it was 2 minutes past. The snarky attitude with which she handled herself made us pause and just decide not to even order drinks and just get burgers for the kids as it had been a long day of sightseeing. The burgers were ok - nothing special. The service for the rest of the night was more of the same. Terrible attitude of waitress in delaying clearing food and getting bill‚Ä¶ and yes, we know that this is not usually a quick process. At the end more snarky attitude in comments made and how she handled herself. It also dawned on us that this establishment has a lot of signs about how good their TripAdvisor ratings are. We‚Äôve come to notice that the more places tout those the worse they are, and this was no exception. We‚Äôre sorry to have tried this place and with so many other options you can definitely find something better."
204,Aubrey provided great service when we came in for happy hour and appetizers. Great atmosphere and drinks!
205,"Love the beers! Our waitress was polish, it was cool to meet someone from my own country while being in Paris. Awesome service, I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good drink. Thanks Marika!"
206,"The title says it all‚Ä¶Marika was able to provide us with the best service and the best smile.  She was even able to Mix Gin with a Blond beer..OK, i think you should add it on the menu; in fact, how is it not there yet?  Cheers!!!"
207,"We were looking to hang out for a couple hours before our next event during our vacation to Paris, but ended up staying longer because the drinks were good, happy hour was a good deal, and Victoire, our server was excellent! Definitely very fun and lively atmosphere and a young crowd, which we enjoyed. I think coming here with a group of friends would be perfect but even good for solo people if you‚Äôre comfortable with making friends. Anyway, if you‚Äôre in Paris and you like to go to fun bars,"
208,"Best place to have a beer around. We were helped by the wonderfull, the famous, th√© unique Zlata. Ici c‚Äôest Paris"
209,"My friends and I were looking for a good nice bar to spend the evening and we definitely found it. Great staff, especially a waitress called Aubrey. Would definitely recommend !"
210,"Having researched kid friendly restaurants in Paris, Frog XVI came up so we decided to visit. Having a toddler and trying to find somewhere to eat in Paris (at normal UK dinner time) can be hard, and we were delighted with our choice here. The staff were super friendly towards my little boy, they had highchairs and crayons etc. The food was delicious, both myself and husband had burgers which were so nice. Equally the drinks were good and reasonably priced for Paris and the location (short walk from Trocadero). The children's meal was 7 euros and this included a drink, main course and dessert. My little boy had the fish and chips and ate the lot. Would 100% recommend eating here with kids (and without)! If we ever return to Paris we will be sure to visit again!"
211,"It‚Äôs a very nice place to eat and drink. Only a few minutes away from Eiffel Tower. The prices are absolutely fair, service is great (thanks Carmen) and really fast. Food and drinks are delicious. The house-brewed beer is definitely a recommendation. Try it and love it."
212,"Reserved the room downstairs for a work event and everyone had such a good time drinking and with snacks! Nadyr the manager took great care of us, checking in on us all the time. We will be back here for our future events thanks to him and the wonderful staff!!"
213,"There's this waitress who had the best vibe and service. Her name was Diana. When you go there, ask for her and she'll take care of you just fine. She looks like a frog a little bit that's why she works there but she always has big smile and great service. Don't forget to leave a tip if you enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar."
214,Delicious food (cheeseburgers) and great selection of interesting beers. The restaurant was busy and had an awesome vibe. But even with it being busy we had excellent service from Ipek and will definitely be back even though we're only in Paris for a few days!
215,Great place to have drinks with friends. Good selection of beers in different formats including pichets :). If you need good advices for choice ask Diana for perfect service
216,"Go there, enjoy delicious beer and food *and ask to be serviced by Diana! She rocks!! Best service I‚Äôve ever had in Paris."
217,Cielo recommeded some fantastic beer while jason worked really hard to provide us with the ginger beer. Fantastic staff and really lovely people
218,"This Restaurant Is Wonderful! The food And Staff are great and very very friendly! The beer cocktails are a must here. Would definitely come back. Ask for Carmen, she was Excellent! My wife and I split their Pick 4 Appetizers and it was plenty of food!"
219,Nice service Fast and gently I recommended her The food is very good and you are really satisfied at the end
220,"Really enjoy at this place, also the best waiter Jason was serving and everything was perfect. Best beer place at Paris."
221,Good beers and burgers shout out to aubrey and ipek for the excellent service !! nice hair btw üòâ .....
222,"The best beer in Paris. My favorite is ginger beer! Very near Eiffel Tower! Good service, Waitress Marika is great! See you soon!"
223,"Delicious homemade beer, close to eiffle tower and arc de triomphe and very helpful waitress Marika."
224,"Went there with a friend, the barista Carmen is very nice, would recomand for nice ambiance, the beer is good and the wine is cheap"
