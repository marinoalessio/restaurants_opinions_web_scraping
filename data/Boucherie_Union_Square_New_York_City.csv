1,"My wife and I went for my birthday on Friday night. We were seated by the window. Our waitress was very solicitous and professional. The service in general was professional, helpful and understated. More importantly, the food was without exception very good. We had the octopus as an appetizer. It was very well-prepared, and it came with a tasty, spicy plate of vegetables. The bread given to us was also tasty -- traditional French baguette of high quality. We ordered two entrees: a fish dish and a heaping pile of mussels. Both were very good. The fish was not oily, and the mussels were delicious and cooked with great restraint. Neither had too much butter or fat. With the mussels, we received some of the best fries I've had in years. Altogether: excellent! My wife ordered a glass of white wine, and I had a cocktail. Both were fine. When we were leaving, they brought us two gifts as we had indicated that it was my birthday. One was a recipe book, and the other was a pop-up toy! The staff was incredibly warm, and they made it a wonderful evening. Two caveats: the restaurant can be quite loud, and it is expensive. But it was worth it. New York is full of mediocre bistros and brasseries. This was anything but. The people running Boucherie know what they're doing."
2,"We were very pleased with the delicious food the evening my husband and I visited Boucherie Union Square. I had the filet and my husband had the lamb chops; both were excellent! We also enjoyed the desserts, however we felt the entrees were definitely the showstoppers. Prices seemed appropriate for the quality of the food we were served.  All in all, we loved Boucherie! I highly recommend!"
3,Boucherie Union square is a beautiful restaurant however it is really lacking good waiters I had dinner there last night with a group of friends. The waiter was bad first he didn’t offer us any appetizers went straight to the entrées then disappeared for like thirty minutes we sat at the table looking at each other while we waited for or main course to arrive the food was amazing I just wish I had the full experience instead half. And the sad part is the person that invited use is the mother of the chef so you would have thought they would have given us a waiter that had at least a little more training or experience.
4,From the begonia was excelente the Service. Gaudí was a really nice anfrition. Everithing was good. The muscles were amazing i have never tasted before. O apreciarte. Thank you so much
5,"We dined at Boucherie Union Square during a recent trip to NYC. The restaurant is very beautiful inside and was decorated nicely for Christmas. The service was fantastic (We had Ibrahim, who was very thoughtful and attentive. He even took our photo in front of the tree for us as we were leaving). The food was very good and came out promptly. The prices are, I would say, on par with other steak house type restaurants in NYC. Overall I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to others."
6,Lovely ambience and delicious food. Highly recommend this restaurant for a quiet evening with a great meal. The escargot were wonderful
7,Excellent service good management nice and polite people .. i will definitely visit again !! I enjoyed my time thank you for everything.
8,"I hope to visit this beautiful place, It has a good service from its employees. Probably the best carnivore in the world"
9,The raw bar is mediocre. The steak is good. But fries are cold and peppercorn sauce tastes like bisque soup. Not the best. And double the price of a steak elsewhere. Yes its fancy. But if the food sucks?
10,"We are here in NYC for two days and have known Namik for years so the choice to come here for dinner was an easy one! Everything was so perfect that we had dinner here two nights in a row. Between our two visits, we had steak, fish, pasta, desserts, and drinks! Namik always provides the best service and the entire staff was so welcoming. The space is very neat, and decorated beautifully for the holidays. We will most definitely be back during our next NYC trip!"
11,The service and the atmosphere was great. Boucherie Union Square has beautiful holiday decorations. The food was delicious food. The Profiteroles was an amazing dessert.
12,"I went to this restaurant for Thanksgiving and the food was amazing. The octopus, steak, and Turkey were all cooked to perfection. The service was also top notch.

I would highly recommend and will definitely be back."

The food was delicious I ordered the Wagyu burger which was cooked so well I was so happy, the steak tartare was delectable and the cocktails were the perfect addition to a splendid meal. I recommend this place for any occasion, a meal and an unforgettable experience."
35,Delicious food. Although a little pricey. We had a nice brunch on Saturday and would definitely go back. Maybe next time try dinner.
36,We came to Boucherie after a long day from the office and immediately after getting to the restaurant they sat us down with no reservation which was amazing especially on a Friday evening. We had a waiter named Gaudi who took care of us all night. We took his advice on the steak for two and the sides and it didn’t disappoint! Ask for Gaudi!! When coming here!! Truly the best experience!
37,"Service was Excellent , our waiter Gaudi did an incredible job and my husband and I were very much satisfied! Will come back & recommend. ( Ask for Gaudi ) !!!"
38,Only perfection Staff was very friendly and kind. Food was mouthwatering I just couldnt stop myself eating. Dear Hüseyin Sezgin done very well job.
39,"I just had the disgruntled pleasure of dining at Boucherie located on Park Avenue South. From the minute we set foot in the restaurant, we were greeted with warm smiles and seated within seconds even though it was a busy night. My party was attended to by Oscar who was attentive and guided out choices. We were treated with kindness and respect. The delicious and palate pleasing food was just the icing on the cake. We had Oysters, Escargots, Onion Soup, Duck and much more. This was one of the best experiences I had on this trip to NYC. To cap off the evening, the manager, Hussein, came to our table and engaged us in a lovely conversation and gave us a gift. FWIW, we don’t always get treated with respect but OScar and Hussein went above and beyond. We will not only come back but we will bring our friends. Thank you, Boucherie and thank you, Hussein and Oscar!! Run to this restaurant."
40,"My friends from NYC recommended me this restaurant and I’ve been impressed how delicious it was! The staff was super friendly and the food très bien, merci"

Ate with my husband and our 2 adult daughters ( one is vegetarian) and we all had great food, My husband had the Beef Bourginon which he said was the best meal he’s ever had! Everything was excellent, the food, service, atmosphere and drinks. If you’re looking for a special place to eat out during your trip you can’t go wrong here. Was expensive but worth it for a very special evening."
50,"Wait staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. Mussels and mushroom ravioli were my favorite! For dessert, I highly highly recommend the creme brûlée, so silky and smooth! The cocktails were also pretty good as well. Would definitely recommend for others and would come back again!"

57,"I have been to their Grand Central location first and foremost during the Winter and had a wonderful time. This time around, I visited their Union Square location for a weekend brunch and they had $17 for half a dozen oysters! With selections from both East and West Coast! They were super fresh! I paired with a pinot gris from Alsace and their specialty cocktail La Vie En Rose. Both were delicious! Their wide selection of classic French Bistro menu was great! I loved the duck confit and steak frites. And I found their portions generous. I was almost full off of the appetizers!  PS: Don't miss the dessert and coffee! The chocolate tart was soooo rich in flavor! And the profiteroles with vanilla icecream and rich chocolate syrup hit the spot!"

68,First time at the Boucherie and union square location. Went in for the oyster promotion currently running for half a dozen oyster for $17 and they suggest wine pairing with the oyster.

69,Everything was very yummy and a great atmosphere! The steak frites was cooked to perfection! Can’t wait to come back!

71,Our server Alex was great and friendly and the food came out in a timely manner. The appetizers were delicious I would recommend the pate with the pastry around it.
72,The food was wonderful and our waiter Javier was the best! The filet mignon was my favorite dish. This restaurant is definitely one of my favorites in New York!
73,"It was 95 degrees and in route to our hotel we stumbled upon Boucherie from Times Square. Perfect classic French food. Our waiter Javier V was exceptional. I ordered a very dirty martini, got a very dirty and wasn’t my thing. Javier was so kind and understanding of my mistake. I got a replacement perfect martini in minutes. Wonderful dinning experience!"
74,"Javier was excellent and polite! The food was very tasty and even pretty, I would definitely recommend this place and come again!"
75,A lovely restaurant with great food! The service was slow and we often had to flag down our server when needing water refills and the check. The ambiance was beautiful and there was a large flower display visualized on first entrance that added to the decor nicely. The Croque Madame and coffee was delicious and I would definitely recommend.
76,Alessandro was an awesome waiter so attentive! The food was fantastic. Best Foie Gras outside of Paris. Very open airy a perfect spot for great food and cocktail.
77,My husband and I came to celebrate his birthday and we had such a lovely time. The service is fantastic and Gaudi was very nice. He brought a little cake for my husband and even a present. I definitely recommend this place.
78,"The food was good. I had the wagyu burger, oysters, creme brule and strawberry tart. I was really satisfied with the food."
79,I had a lovely time at The Boucherie. We had reservations at 7:30pm but came earlier because we were early. We lucked out and got a table at 6:30pm. The server was attentive and speedy. I had the steak frites with fries. The fries were really yummy. Crispy and hot. The steak was also delicious.
80,"I enjoyed my stay at Boucherie Union Square! It’s a great space for couples to dine at for special occasions. The Wagyu Burger is delicious — definitely would recommend trying it.  Service is a bit slow and servers don’t make conversation with you. Also, WiFi connection is weak in the restaurant."
81,"Very good steak, chicken pallar and escargot for Lunch with friends. Great service made our afternoon a fun time!! Open space with terrace to Park Ave!. Thanks to Gaudí, excellent server for cappuccinos and dessert recommendation! ;). ;)"

87,Incredible food and a nice indoor/outdoor setup. Alessio took great care of us. Drinks were tall and strong.
88,"The food was amazing! I got to try French onion soup and escargot for the first time. It was a great experience. We also had an amazing charcuterie board with this great French cheese (i also never tried), meats, and it was accompanied by some raw honey, grapes, walnuts, mustard, strawberries and pickles! The fillet minion was amazing as well. The spinach was perfectly sautéed and the truffle butter made it all better. We ended our dinner with an amazing creme brûlée! Our server Michael was great at informing us about the menu as well. He gave great suggestions and was so amazing as well. You guys HAVE to come and experience this place! Totally worth it!"
89,"I went here with my friend, and we mostly shared small appetizers. Escargots, probably the best french onion soup I've ever had, bread, butter, camembert, and prosciutto. Paired with two cocktails (I ended up ordering two of the La Vie en Rose, which I'd highly recommend), and followed by a perfectly cooked, tender filet mignon. The service, from our server Michael in particular, was efficient, professional, unobtrusive, and very pleasant. I'll certainly be back! (The creme brulée and espresso martini were both also wonderful)"
90,Don’t get me wrong. The food was delicious but the vibe and service (thanks to Alex) was even better. He made it a point to make sure we had everything we needed throughout our dinner and the service could not have been better. Ask to be sat with him! You won’t regret it!
91,Highly recommend…food was delicious. Love the atmosphere…Great service…thank you Alex for taking great care of us!!
92,We loved Boucherie and we adored Mike! Everything was fantastic from cocktails to wine to the food. We ordered the seafood tower which was fresh and delicious.

101,The food was delicious not the most affordable restaurant in the city but if you’re feeling the brasserie feels or a terrasse with some good French food you won’t be disappointed. Amazing service from the staff especially Alex - so good it’s the only tell tale sign you’re not actually in France!

108,Wanted to dine on French cuisine and upon searching came across this restaurant.

134,"My friends made us a reservation at this restaurant and on the way downtown, I noticed that it was the number NINE restaurant in New York City according to TripAdvisor. I love TripAdvisor, I love New York City, and I love Restaurants. I also love rating things so that they are appropriately placed in my mind. Empire Strikes Back is the best of the nine Star Wars movies. New York City is the greatest city in the world. Abraham Lincoln was the second-best president in US history (George Washington is number 1). These are all subjective, but they help me make sense of an otherwise confusing world.  There is no way that Boucherie Union Square is the #9 restaurant in New York City. It is an average to below average French Steakhouse that is ridiculously overpriced. My meal, the Australian ""Entrecote"" was impossibly rubbery. The side salad was coated in vegetable oil. The French Fries were a pale knockoff of a McDonald's French Fry.  The food is also completely un-customizable. My friend asked for her Salmon well done and they could not accommodate her. My wife asked for french fries and salad and that could not be done. I expect that at a low-end place, but at a place where the entrees are over $50? No way.  The service was fine, but slow and impersonal.  My sense is that the Boucherie team knows how to market by leveraging these platforms and power to them. It's a skill. It should not be a skill that is in any way related to running a high-end New York City restaurant.  The funny thing is that if it wasn't for TripAdvisor, I would have been ""meh, a NYC restaurant somewhere in the middle of my NYC dining experiences."" However, given my love of New York City, TripAdvisor and the concept of ratings, I feel compelled to leave this review. This is not the #9 restaurant in New York City. No way."
135,"We were looking for a place where my family and I would find a good place to experience in NYC, we decided to come to this wonderful place. we arrive without reservation and even so the wait was only about 15 minutes, then a waiter attended us who made the whole day make sense, his service was excellent, we ate everything he recommended and every decision was perfect, I recommend that if they come ask for JAVIER V. excellent service, very friendly and expresses the content of the menu very well, in a few words a great experience! Thank you Javier V."
136,"The food was amazing!! I loved the atmosphere and the drinks were great. Mike was the best waiter. He was so kind, patient and attentive. Would definitely recommend!!"
137,"Michele was an incredible server. Very kind and made sure that everyone was cared for. Food was great. Has the bavette and friends had the steak frites. Escargot was great as well. Recommend for any birthday event, or even an intimate date."
138,Love the ambiance and good service in this cute little union square spot! Highly recommended for anyone looking for an intimate and delicious meal
139,"I had a late lunch with my friend . Great choice! Loved everything about the place. I will definitely come back. It’s a nice place for a date night, dinner or lunch with friends. Classy nice place. P.S. They have good cocktails 🍹"
140,"It is a fantastic place. The environment is fabulous, and the service is excellent—best service ever at the bar. I would recommend this restaurant without a doubt!"
141,Alessandro was great!! He was a very sweet waiter and was very attentive and patient with the order. He was knowledgeable about the menu. He made our experience here lovely !!!
142,"Visited Boucherie to celebrate a friends promotion and the service was amazing - Alessandro was super attentive and checked in regularly and had great recommendations. The food was also delicious - we split the seafood tower, steak tartare and escargot (a must have!). I had the wagyu burger which was so filling and the drinks are very tasty, def recommend the la vie en rose. I’ll be back with my fiancé."
143,"I really enjoyed my first time here. The atmosphere is nice. You are able to enjoy a first date, anniversary or if you’re anything like me, some head down time. It’s nice to get some work done in a wonderful atmosphere. And my server was nice."
144,"Great meal in a great setting. Boucherie feels like an authentic French bistro. Our servers were very attentive, even at the late hour my wife and I ate and the food was fantastic. Our steak was cooked to perfection and the drinks were excellent as well. We will definitely be going back on our next trip."
145,If you are visiting NYC definitely take some time to visit Boucherie! All locations are gorgeous and service is great. The steak frites is delicious!
146,"I came here for the first time after seeing it all over my Instagram feed, and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The food was delicious, the decor and vibe inside felt great/undercover cool, and my waiter, Alessandro, was the absolute sweetest. This is the type of place I could come by at any hour of the day, multiple times a week. It’s definitely going to be my new go-to hangout. We even received a coffee table book for free! I got a side salad to start, the striped bass w/ a side of fries, and split crème brûlée and the paris Brest with a friend. We ended up loving the crime brûlée the most - it was divine. Also, no clue how they made something as simple as salad taste so amazing and refreshing, but they did lol. If you don’t mind paying a little bit more for quality dining, this is the place to go to. I will be back! PS Try the PJ Breeze!"
147,"The service here was impeccable, everyone is super friendly. The food and drinks, definitely the best part!!! I’ll be back!! The waiter Alexandro was the best mwah ! X"
148,My brother and I visited this location for a Birthday Dinner and were thrilled with our experience. The staff (Alessandro in particular) we’re very attentive and respectful and the steak was delicious. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion or a third date perhaps!
149,Fantastic dinner! Alessandro was so lovely and helpful. Very attentive and catered to our needs throughout to the entire evening. The mussels and oysters were so delicious - some of the best I ever had. Thank you for a great night visiting with an old friend and catching up!  Nicole DT
150,Alessandro was the best!!! We had a great time and were met with the best service. We sat right away and the food was AMAZING. Especially the seafood!
151,"It is a good option with good food. We had brunch at Boucherie and ate a norwegian eggs Benedict. It was a good choice, however the place is overpriced and you have the same quality in less expensive places."
152,"I had a great time eating delicious food in this charming place. The staff was comitted to great service and were very friendly. The atmosphere was awesome and I definitely like that you have a small piece of Paris in the middle of New York. Most importantly, food and drink on menu tasted great!"
153,It's like being in Paris without being in Paris. Wonderful ambience and service. Delicious food. I had the french onion soup and creme brulee. Highly recommend! Efe was my server. He was very friendly and attentive! Thank you for a great experience. I'll be back!
154,"Went here on an anniversary date. Great food and ambiance, couldn’t have asked for a better experience!"
155,I brought my girlfriends for a birthday dinner—service and food were fantastic! Highly recommend steak frites. Vibe and ambience is super cute!
156,"We got the steak frites, mussels, mushroom ravioli, and duck leg. Duck was very tender, mussels were fresh. Superb service as well!"
157,"Even though we waited for the food too long it turned an amazing experience, would recommend going there if you guys are not in a rush."
158,"I have been wanting to dine at Boucherie for such a long time and I finally got to .. Upon arrival we were greeted by such a sweet hostess , we did not have a reservation however she promptly seated at a nice table near he window. Our waiter couldn’t been any better, he recommended the escargot which was to die for. We shared the tomahawk, four out of five as it was slightly on the cold side . Regardless, it was a great experience and will definitely come back . The atmosphere makes you feel like you’re in Paris."
159,"My lady and I enjoyed the entrees, desert and the drinks. Amazing service everyone was friendly. Appreciated the suggestions on the dishes. We definitely will be returning. Thank you Boucherie."
160,"Boucherie Union Square boasts delicious French cuisine in a casual yet still elegant atmosphere. With multiple locations in the city, this restaurant is sure to be a good spot to begin or end your night in the Big Apple."
161,Amazing experience! Gaudí was an Exquisite server he helped us with every question we had on the menu! Thank you!!!!!!!
162,ABSOLUTELY LOVED OUR SERVICE! Gaudí took great care of us and made us feel at home. He made sure to help us pick the perfect food/ drink options and gave great recommendations.
163,"It was very nice to be back at Boucherie, my family were visiting from out of town and we forgot to make reservations..we walked into a crowded restaurant however the host was rather kind, he quickly guided us to a very nice warm table towards the back) Our waiters were phenomenal and suggested to start with the seafood tower which serves 2,3 hungry peeps. He had the duck confit, which was great it literally felt off the bone. We shared the ravioli as well as the charcuterie board together with some frites and cream spinach . For desert we order Baba Exotique au Rhum dessert according to the host it has just been added to the menu, we'll done) We couldn't have ask for a better weekend, thank you Boucherie staff"
164,"I should have read some of the reviews more carefully. We were very disappointed, the food was less than average. We have been there before and it was much better a couple of years ago. The issue wasn’t one or two dishes, it was most of them."
165,Me and my husband visited Boucherie Union Square this last Saturday for a brunch. We were amazed by the tradicional french decoration and the great variety from the food menu. You can find anything from a typical brunch food to a delightful French cuisine. Our server Matthew was super attentive and made our Saturday even better. Would love to come back again!
166,"Came here for a date with my boyfriend and not only was the service great but the food was even better! I got the Branzino, the sauce and veggies were so tasty! He ordered the Ribeye! We'll definitely be coming back again for the spring/summer!"
167,"Came here with my boyfriend for a lovely weekday dinner and was again blown away by the experience. This is our go to French date night spot. We enjoyed escargot, Cesar salad, and the lyonnaise salad to share followed by steak frites and the steak bavette. Everything was outstanding! Our server Alessandro made the whole night that much better with his impeccable, well timed service. Overall would recommend to anyone who loves great food and great service."
168,"Last minute dinner, staff was incredibly accommodating. Alessandro was a spectacular server, attentive and knowledgeable. Service was perfectly timed and exceptional. Recommend the steak frites and salad lyonnaise! A wonderful New York experience."
169,The best food! Great stuff! Highly recommended!! Bartender Renè was amazing. Very knowledgeable about the food and drinks!!
170,"Came to hang out with friends, and found it a great stay. The steak fites and the escargoe were delicious"
171,It's a beautiful restaurant and the service was OK. I ordered the onion soup and I thought I had covid because it had no taste. There was no depth of flavor even with the gruyere I didn't get anything out of it. The escargot were served properly but they too were lacking in flavor (to me). My daughter's french toast was undercooked. The steak frites was the best entree brought to the table. It was cooked properly and the butter served with it maybe should've been used the season the escargot and the soup because those were super bland. The Sorbet we had for dessert and the champagne by the glass was excellent as well.
172,"Steak Frites was on the Restaurant Week menu at Boucherie but only on the weekdays. Nevertheless when I was there on Sunday, early February, I ate this expensive entrée and savored each and every mouthwatering bite. The large piece of meat topped with Béarnaise sauce was sublime. Shoestring fries were crisp on the outside but over fried on the inside. The servers were friendly and professional. I had no room for dessert."
173,"It was a very disappointing evening, Average at best and definitely did not live up to the reviews on TripAdvisor. We started with escargot and French onion soup, both of which were only average and the soup at Bobby Vans steakhouse in NYC was far superior. Entrée were duck confit leg and salmon papillote Looked quite appealing but were lacking in flavor. Even the vodka martinis were quite average. The only highlight was the fresh bread and the attentive bus boys. This restaurant is very noisy and charges fine dining prices, but with only average food and service. the hostess was surly at best. We skipped dessert assuming it would not be any better."
174,"An all together dissapointing evening. From the outset we were sat on a table barely large enough for two people (there was 3 of us), drafty & noisy, from the insesent banging of the front door, even above the general buzz of the diners. Bang, bang bang bang, for the entire meal!!  We ordered champagne, they did not have the bottle we ordered, offered an alternative, at a higher price (that old trick!). The waiter 'sloshed' it in our glasses, with overspill onto the table."
175,"If you're looking for french food, definitely go to that one. Amazing place with great traditional french food. They also serve great brunch during week ends."
176,"This restaurant adventures to French recipes that are not your average ones. Try the Coq au Vin. Their salads are original amd varied and their meats prepared perfectly. Pricy, bit a treat. Don't miss it as it is behind scaffolding nowadays."
177,A real french style bistro. Gorgeous space. Nice (a little snobby) staff. Food is delicious. Great way to spend an evening.
178,We had a good dinner there but the place didn’t look so clean for the c19 standards. The place looks very nice with a beautiful Christmas tree inside. The food was good. Good wine list. Good meat. The receptionist lady was spending more time on her phone than looking after the service or the clients. A director should be hire to fix the service and the global team…
179,"Had high hopes given the reviews, the restaurant and staff were great but unfortunately the food wasn’t up to the same standard, the rib eye steak was mostly fat, well over 50%, so didn’t make for a pleasant experience. As I say I had high hopes but felt the quality of the food was very average and overpriced."
180,"Stepping into Boucherie felt like I was transported to a traditional brasserie in France. Adding to that were soaring ceilings, a row of suspended jambon, as well as smartly dressed and attentive waiters. The escargot was lovely, while the steak frites was done to perfection. The strip loin was juicy, just right in its doneness and had a nice charred flavour that somehow eludes so many steaks out there. But the first to assault your senses would be the fragrance of the fries, which comes in a generous heap."
181,The steak was cooked to perfection. The escargot was very generous. The service was outstanding. The drinks were great. The location is beautiful.
182,"We ordered the chateaubriand for two adults and two children - perfect amount of steak for the four of us! The kids enjoyed the berry non-alcoholic drink. The service was fantastic, with incredible patience resetting the table service after a spilled drink."
183,Dusan is amazing. Great mixologist!!!! Order drinks from him! Nice atmosphere. Nice people. Easy going but professional appeal.
184,"Loved the ambience from the moment I walked in. The hostess was extremely nice and sat us in the perfect table. Our server was attentive, informed, and well spoken! He recommended the steak tartar and the filet with celery root gratin, it was phenomenal!! 10/10 would definitely come back."
185,"We are visiting NYC from Houston for a long weekend. We love a good French bistro so when we saw this wonderful place was #1 on Trip Advisor, it had to be our first dinner stop.  It did not disappoint. If you have ever seen Somethings Got to Give with Nicholson and Keaton, you know the famous last part of the movie when they are eating at Le Grande Colbert in Paris.  Keaton says that bistro has the best roast chicken EVER. No no. The best is Boucherie in NYC! The skin is so crispy it cracks when you cut into the meat. And juicy, tender! Ooo la la!  The steak frites with compound butter? Incredibly delicious!  Delightful wine selections by the glass and amazing bread service.  The desserts are to die for! Dense chocolate mousse with lovely presentation and crepes suzette that is out of this world. Absolutely deserving of its number one ranking!"
186,This place is beautiful!! Highly recommend it for a cocktail! Service is on point! So happy we came here! Definitely coming back!! Food looks good too but didn’t get a chance to order! Will do so next time!!
187,Had a wonderful meal at Boucherie Union Sq. Our server Michele was very attentive and gave us great recommendations for drinks and entrees. Would highly recommend!
188,"Michele was very friendly, and attentive. The food was also amazing. The L’etranger cocktail was delicious!"
189,"PROS Quality of food, quantity of food, the overall menu was very well organized. Sunday brunch is phenomenal, service is very nice and inside atmosphere is nice. Position is very good, easy to find.  CONS A bit pricey and crowded, but nothing too bad overall  Definitely a good place in New York City"
190,"Read. This. Review. Amazing food. The burger is to die for. The Lychee martinis are unmatched. And our server Michele is an absolute gem. I would come back here 1,000 times over— amazing atmosphere, vibes, and walked outside to mistakenly find myself on Park Ave when I should’ve been in front of the Eiffel Tower based on my experience here."
191,"Such a lovely ambiance for a group of old friends to enjoy each other’s company with a burger, fries, and espresso martinis."
192,"Great service from Michele! Good good, friendly staff. Burger is great. Apps are good to share with friends."
193,My friends and I had a fabulous evening here. Steak tartare and ribeye was delicious. Michele was a lovely server and we will definitely come back.
194,What a wonderful dining experience! Incredible food and vibes. Michele our server was amazing and gave great recommendations. I can’t wait to come back!
195,"Wonderful vegan burger, cheese platter and superb service! Beautiful restaurant. Will definitely return."
196,"I invited several college friends here for dinner on our last day in NYC. We had to book an early dinner and the large, beautiful restaurant was largely empty. Service was excellent. I had the coq au vin, which was really good. The cocktails were pretty decent as well."
197,"Went for dinner with a friend, food was great and was impressed with their strict covid protocols. We had the escargot, Coq au vin, and the cod, all of which I recommend. My friend recommends the steak frites as well!"
198,Excellent service/Food. Renne was great. Atmosphere was also great and drinks were great as well 10/10
199,Wonderful! Food drinks and dessert were delicious. The venue is beautiful. The staff was great! My friend had a wonderful celebration!
200,The food here is absolutely delicious! The staff - especially our server Rene - was attentive and gave great recommendations on both steaks and wine. I would highly suggest anyone visiting the city stop by Boucherie in union square for dinner! Also John who was on staff here was fantastic. A must-go location for any occasion in the city!
201,"Wow. I am so speechless. This is my first time in NY and the first place I visited and I am in LOVE. Truly a great experience. Food, customer service and environment was superb. Renee and John were AMAZING! So attentive and sweet. Will definitely be back and will recommend to everyone."
202,"The food is great, also the service, and it’s great to have a nice dinner with friends. I absolutely recommend this place."
203,I visit Boucherie few times and every time i had amazing experience. Food is great as well as service and management. Cocktails are the best I ever had. Bartender Rene has great knowledge and make them with passion. I will definitely come back again. Thank you Boucheire at Union Square
204,Best Restaurant in NEW YORK CITY!! Boucherie at Union square have amazing cocktails and food! Service experience is the best you can have. See you soon.
205,"Inspired on a real french bistro, this NY restaurant is a very nice option when visiting the Union Square area. Their menu is completely French inspired and they execute it quite well."
206,Exceptional French cuisine with an increíble menu options. Strongly recommend the onion soup and pâté de campagne for starters. Dinner platters were larger than expected - come with an appetite. Service was exquisite
207,"My boyfriend and I went to Boucherie for dinner with a friend of ours. We all really enjoyed our meals. I had the filet mignon with pomme frites and hericot verts. The steak was amazing, as were the sides. For dessert I had the creme brulee, which was also delicious. Our servers were very nice and our food came at a good pace. We were able to sit halfway inside and outside, which was nice. I would definitely recommend giving Boucherie a try."
208,"This was supposed to be the highlight of our trip to NYC. That ""#3"" finally convinced us, as Tripadvisor -prior to the pandemic- had been our ""guiding light.""  In short, what was the only outstanding dish? The escargots. What was the most disappointing (and expensive) one? The canard. It tasted as if the chef had been tired and ready to go home. The rest was barely above average.  Our pinot noir should not have been on the menu, at least not for that price.  The photos on Tripadvisor are really enticing and were part of our decision to reserve a table... well a 4"" diameter shaky wooden panel. The table was in the middle of a walkway between two larger ones. Our waiter had to walk sideways to sneak through. I was in constant fear of getting splashed on with passing food trays. NY is feeling the brunt of another pandemic wave, but we were sitting so close to the other tables that we could hear those conversations (despite the noise). This takes to another annoying item: the noise.  We left without ordering any dessert.  Honestly, $300 for a dinner for two (as said, without dessert) deserves much better food and a much better ambiance."
209,I met a friend for lunch. There is a nice outdoor seating space and the decor indoors is lovely. I had the Boucherie burger which was really average and not worth the price. My friend had the mussels and really liked them. Fries were great and the service was fine.
210,"Food was great, very nice outdoor seating (inside too), nice bar. We had the wagyu steak it was delicious."
211,"A wonderful meal. Chateaubriand - a masterpiece with the sauce, perfectly cooked meat, bone marrow, and vegetables. Chocolate mousse, a delightful cheese, French prosciutto, and hericot verts."
212,Fantastic food. Incredible steak tartar. Delicious meat! Perfect place for food meat lovers. Service friendly and kind. Recommended
213,"Boucherie was exactly what my boyfriend and I were looking for when in New York City for a fancier dinner spot. Ordered the steak frites, which was absolutely amazing and the service was very friendly and helpful as well. Restaueant has a romantic vibe in a historic NYC building. Would definitely recommend."
214,"I have walked past this restaurant a thousand times but only came in for a bite after speaking to the delightful Aya! She was warm, pleasant, upbeat. Everything she recommended from cocktails ( la vie en rose) to the burger were delicious. Next time I’m definitely saving room for the Profiteroles!"
215,My friends and I had a wonderful meal. We had three different orders and all were brought on time. The place was very clean. We would go there again.
216,"AMAZING RESTAURANT, the drinks were phenomenal and the service was amazing. Bartender Michelle will treat you right!!!"
217,Excellent restaurant … the food is delicious … fast service and a very good atmosphere … I recommended 100%
218,"Great service , amazing food , beautiful place. We will comeback soon for an other amazing brunch !!"
219,"We loved the food, the service and the ambiance! Every thing was clean and all wearing masks. Food was wonderful. All four had something different and we each loved it."
220,"Such a cute & delicious French restaurant right by union square! The service was great, ask for Michele! He recommended the goat cheese salad & it was the perfect appetizer. The outdoor dining set up was cute & staff was very covid safe. Would totally go back!!!"
221,"It was my first time at Boucherie and it was absolutely amazing! We celebrated my besties birthday and we felt like some fancy gals! We loved our gorgeous serve Michele, he was so sweet and attentive. Definitely recommend!"
222,Meal was amazing - over generous portions with an innovative selection of cocktails to select from. Outdoor dining was well spaced out and indoor dining had partitions as well. Service was very fast - special shout out to our amazing server Michele! Will be coming back.
223,Amazing food amazing service! Was nice to be out after a year of not enjoying dining out.. come and enjoy the food atmosphere and service
224,My fiancé and I recently moved to Gramercy. This restaurant will definitely be a regular for us! The food was exquisite. We especially need to pay complement to Michele. He made our experience exceptional. We look forward to returning often.
