The waiters were helpful and polite, and ready to translate the whole menu if we needed it. The food was really great, simple dishes but very well done and perfectly sized.  All in all, a really lovely restaurant with heart and warmth, great food and a staff that really cares about the guests!"

30,"Verse Toujours is an absolute gem - with its quirky decor, thoughtful drinks menu, amazing food (in hearty portions!) & wonderful staff (especially Olga) who were always on-hand with suggestions and offers of ‚Äòsecret‚Äô dishes from the kitchen . We went as a family on a quick Paris break over Christmas and it was the highlight of our trip!"

38,"We were in Paris for a week and this by far was the best dining experience we had. They have enough seating for almost any size party (we were party of 6), they spoke English, were friendly and attentive, and THE FOOD. We basically ate family style, and tried 6 different meals, 4 different desserts, and 5 different drinks. Everything was immaculately prepared and a pleasure with every bite. Bartender was particularly fun and made everyone feel welcome. Will return!"
39,A must for your trip to Paris. The place is packed with charm in the heart of Paris. The staff were extremely attentive and polite. The food was excellent! Try the cheese board ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs divine. Food was served very quickly and piping hot! I would recommend this place without any doubt.
40,Nice neighborhood Paris Bistro. The food was well prepared and flavorful. The service was attentive. It is a quint spot off the beaten path
41,if you want to have dinner at reasonable prices with french neighbors and the possibility to sit outside you are absolutely right here. We had a nice dinner and will definitely return.
42,"Sitting outside on the terrace and observing the world go by while enjoying a meal or libation at a Parisian caf√© is an immense pleasure. What separates Verse Toujours from the countless other venues is not the food (although the food and desserts are quite good, particularly the brioche sundae!) nor the drinks (although they too are fantastic‚Ä¶ try the Jo-Jo!)‚Ä¶ no, what sets Verse Toujours apart is the joyful, attentive staff.  Our server, Olga, was happy to engage and joke with our table (in English‚Ä¶ and in our limited French), helping us through the menu, and the bartender (although always working hard behind the bar) found a way to smile and exchange pleasantries on both our visits. Great experience, went back multiple times in the evening after our long days of exploring."
43,"The staff is friendly, relaxed atmosphere, pleasant decor and away from the tourists; had the salmon, nice presentation and good food; good value for your money. Visited twice during our week in Paris"
44,We haven't felt we've been served in a restaurant but welcomed as friends at our last evening in Paris. We are happy to found this place and recommend to everyone visiting the city as you can dine in a cozy atmosphere. Definitely try the Entrecote and the Tartar du Saumon. Bon appetit!
45,"Burgers were excelent. Service was pleasent. Only con is that whole terrace is smoking area, so we were really smoked after our dinner."
46,The best service you‚Äôll find! So friendly and legendary people! I‚Äôm Australian so I know good service when I see it! Recommended restaurant for the best feed! Ask for Olga she will deliver! üíú
47,"Not only is the food fantastic and decently priced, but the service is top-notch. My friend and I came back night after night to sit on the patio and watch the world go by. A superb address!"
48,"If you want to feel at home - then only this restaurant, Whatever language you speak, you will be spoken to in your language: French, English, Spanish, Ukrainian and others. A huge selection of dishes and the quality of cooking attracts to this restaurant again and again, add to this a charming young girl who manages it all and remember most of her visitors and their tastes. I strongly recommend,"
49,"Defo in our top 3 meals in Paris.  After a very hot day and 10 miles of walking we decided to eat at this place after having had a few of their (amazing) cocktails here over the last few days. What a call that was!  Had the mixed charcuterie and cheese board to start, chicken burger and the veggie bowl to follow. I‚Äôm quite a big eater but this lot had me stuffed. Amazing quality food, clearly made with a lot of thought and passion. Service was also top notch, attentive without being overbearing.  Don‚Äôt even think about it, go here."
50,"Thank you very much for having us in this beautiful restaurant! The food is amazing, especially salade Gobelins! D√©coration is also very very well done, so the only thing you can do is just to enjoy! Thank you"
51,"Excellent all around!! We loved this place so much that we kept going back during our week in Paris. The atmosphere is fun and the decor is upbeat. The menu is delicious, fresh and creative. The drinks and desserts are outstanding (√éle flotant is to die for!!). The staff is super friendly, attentive and accommodating to people with food allergies. Everyone speaks perfect English, but they are so nice, they even put up with our attempts at speaking in French. A real gem!!"
52,"Visited this bar with some friends and had the best experience! Olga, the owner, was such a blast! The food menu is outstanding and the cocktail list is superb! The bar has an amazing terrace if you wish to sit outside, and a spacious inside with awesome decor! 10/10, would recommend to anyone visiting Paris!"
53,Great cocktails. Friendly waiters. Fun upbeat atmosphere. My daughter and I enjoyed a loverly dinner last night. It was our only dinner in Paris so it had to be good. It was!
54,"Nothing special with the food, but excellent service.  We were a party of 5 and had 5 different dishes. No one raved over their food. It was correctly prepared and presented but lacked any real yummm comment.  I appreciated how no matter which waiter was near the table, they all worked together to bring items to diners at all the tables, not just certain ones.  It was a pleasant experience but nothing to write home about."
55,"Great staff, the coolest owner and very cool vibes ! A bar to spend some quality time, grab a good meal and well made cocktails ü§©ü§©"

67,This bar has such an amazing food and cocktails üòªüòª I highly recommend it üíØ I come here every week and I love it Thank you Olga
68,"Kind of at the end of Mouffetard. Well worth going to. Free of tourists, although an incredibly helpful waitress speaks impeccable English, and is extremely friendly. Good local brasserie with limited, yet well-prepared menu. Good wine selection."
69,"We have visited this restaurant now four or five times over the last two weeks. THe food is amazing but the draw to come back over the last visits has been because of OLGA, their unbelievable server who made us feel as though we were a local in this neighborhood.  Tonight we had a great Cobb salad and Aprerol spritz to start off with. The spritz arrived in a beautiful crystal type glass with a dried orange sitting in its side. One of the best spritz we have experienced, and we have had a lot to critique. The salad was incredible with every vegetable you need, roasted chicken, and lots of avocado. Really good!  We have another week to go and I‚Äôm sure we will be back."
