0,"Having visited twice it was time for a review. Superb traditional style London cafe in cosy surroundings with a log burner in the downstairs dining area. Very friendly staff and genuine, home cooked food. There is also an upstairs dining area.  The choice of breakfasts is amazing and from the set menu you also get toast and a hot drink for around £9.00.  Be warned, its a very busy little place and very popular with a wide range of people from locals, tourists to construction workers and is well deserved. So you may have to wait to find a table. Afiyet Olsun."
1,"I have just spent the weekend in Central London celebrating my 40th birthday. Our group was staying down hhe road from Spitalfields, so we came across Cafe Nora when we were looking for a place for breakfast.  This cute little cafe is very cosy and we were unsure if they would fit our group of 7 in, but they did. The menu was quite extensive, with a range of drinks to boot. We quickly made our choices and our orders were taken shortly after. We were not disappointed!  Several of us went for the Turkish Hash Brown and it was delicious! A great balance of potato, eggs, halloumi and sucek was a treat. Others of our group went with a full english and scrambled eggs on toast and everyone finished their food. The freshley squeezed orange juice, coffees and teas went down well too.  On top of this, the staff were lovely and it is just one of those places which are often quite hard to find in the heart of a commercial area.  The cafe was so good, a group of us went back again the day after to try different food, this time we squeezed in upstairs (a handful of tables up there).  Thank you so much for accommodating us and providing two days of great breakfasts: We will definitely be back if we are in the area."
2,Amazing little cafe with food cooked to perfection and lovely staff. Went for breakfast with the family and all of us loved it. Definitely we will visit again.
3,Came here for an English breakfast after reading the reviews here. Everything is good and the staff are really friendly. A comfortable place with fair price.
4,Really lovely food. Well made plenty of it. A good variety on the card. A small and super cozy place. The staff was really helpful.
5,"We have just been here for breakfast after reading the reviews. It was lovely, great choice of breakfast, big mugs of coffee and amazing service. No hesitation recommending this place"
6,"Nora’s cafe probably the best service I have rated in London! I requested for a fully cooked egg, nothing raw. I think I might use the wrong word, instead of fully cooked, I should ask for well done egg, my bad. The staff wearing a mustard scrunchie did something amazed us. She asked to translate in Google to make her understand what is a fully cooked egg; when the dishes served, she followed up with me if I’m fine with the egg, she asked kitchen to prepare a plate of scrambled eggs just to ensure I have the well done egg for breakfast! Shop was decorated like a lovely living room with dining tables in it. Everything is soooo good and make us feel home. Keep it up your good work Nora’s cafe <3"
7,Tiny little cafe punching above its weight space wise to serve excellent breakfasts and warm hospitality. Great little find whilst staying in E1.
8,we came for brunch and we’re not disappointed. the dishes were really good and so tasty. the staff are friendly. 👍 very cosy place. fair price.
9,"we traveled all the way from Heathrow for a random Sunday breakfast after reading reviews and thought we must try this. it was a well nice hidden cafe. we got a table in under a minute and the staff were very attentive even though they were busy. from the beginning to end it was all good and great. my 8 year old son was looked after, and enjoyed the sweet treats and the end at the till when leaving. a very friendly, busy bustling cafe, and great service does not go missing. its a cosy cute place and everyone there knows a great breakfast it seems. I was not alone. nice family run cafe and upstairs was a good thing. will return for sure one day again."
10,We had breakfast at this cosy cafe. Ordered the breakfast sets that were £7.95 each. All well cooked and we were pleasantly surprised that the cafe lattes we ordered were included in the breakfast sets. I only had to top up £0.75 for the soy milk in my coffee. Overall fantastic value. Will way here again the next time i visit london.
11,"I’m so delighted we stumbled upon Nora this year. The most homely and welcoming cafe in the whole of London, and I’m confident it’s the best fry up too.  We always look forward to our weekly trips here, everyone is so lovely. Amazing every time ❤️"
12,"Excellent breakfast - again! Have visited many times, always very satisfied - friendly staff, very good choice of meals. Highly recommended the the set breakfasts"
13,"A beautiful cafe with great tasting food , love the freshly squeezed orange juice to the big cup of coffee 😄. This place is fast becoming a lunchtime venue . Great value for money and the staff are friendly ."
14,Good value for the price. Fast service and really good and big coffee that comes with it. The only minus is the bathroom which wasnt the cleanest without toilet paper but at least it was there.
15,"Great food, service and value for money. The inside dining area is warm and and Thoroughly recommend."
16,"Visited this delightful Cafe today and had a delicious range of breakfasts, coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. Thank you to all that looked after us today."
17,"At last, a proper café serving a decent, filling breakfast. No frills, just good cooked food with a friendly welcome. So glad I found this place after reading TA reviews. My veggie breakfast and a cup of tea with change from £10."
18,"Nora's Café is literally place to be! Old school interior, lovely personal and really good food for super affordable prices."
19,"We had a choice of this or another cafe across the street. Thankfully we chose this one. Good service, lovely food, nice surroundings and it's in a bustling part of London. Cannot say anything bad about the place. We'll remember this for next time."
20,"Nora’s Cafe has the best breakfast and coffee in Whitechapel. We stayed in London for a week and visited this cafe many times, trying different dishes - and they were all delicious. The owner is very charming and witty, and made us feel very welcome."
21,"I have visited Nora Cafe on many occasions between 6 June 2021 and 18 September 2022. I have ALWAYS found the staff to be most welcoming, friendly and helpful. The selection of food is extensive, the taste delicious and the prices very reasonable. Nora Cafe is an absolute gem and so it must continue."
22,Was at Nora’s twice during my stay - totally enjoyed the exceptional hospitality of Nora and her team and the homely ambience of the cafe. Food is great too but its so much more enjoyable because of her hospitality !
23,"We were fortunate enough to spend 3 nights in London and find this cafe a few minutes away. We ate all 3 breakfasts here and enjoyed each one. The Eggs Benedict were the best I’ve ever had and you must try their fresh squeezed orange juice. We also had paninis on the last full day. The café always had lots of locals which I think is a good sign. You want to eat with a locals eat. Prices were reasonable, the portion size was great, everything was fresh and tasty. Highest recommendation for this cafe."
24,"Delicious food, great service and very reasonable prices. Would recommend the cooked breakfast with bubble and squeak."
25,Great experience. Went based on strong TA reviews. Very pleased. Had the Spanish hash. Very flavorful. Good coffee. service was friendly. Strongly recommend
26,"Just to start off, the food was brilliant. After lurking around on this website and since I was in the area for a meeting later, I had to visit. There did seem to be a lot of workers like me and the staff were nice to everyone which was welcoming. I asked if I could have bolognese with my omelette and they said they were happy to tell the chef. Honestly the food made me feel like I was back home in my mum's kitchen. Also, the orange juice was the freshest I've had at a cafe! I'll for sure visit again when I'm in the area again.  Thanks Nora!"
27,"Found by chance as down a side street and doesn't look that desirable area, BUT GO, fantastic people great food amazing value just great, we stayed at Travellodge round the corner and ate breakfast each day here #superb"
28,"We’re staying just around the corner at Travelodge and decided to give this little cafe a try after seeing some good reviews. What an absolute gem of a place, delicious home cooked food and the staff were lovely and friendly. Everything we saw looked amazing. We’re here for one more night and will definitely be back. Just one thing, it’s quite small inside so if more than 2 people it might be worth calling ahead to reserve a table. No fotos sorry we were too hungry"
29,"What a gem, super friendly, delicious food, plenty of choice and all in cosy surroundings. A pity our stay in the area wasn’t longer!!!"
30,"what a wonderfull place to eat perfect foods and drink delicious coffee. Staff and Nora are so kindfull . Prices are little, dishes are big. When i go to the spitalfield market , i usually eat here . Thank you all of you Nora Cafe"
31,"A great place for a quiet, traditional British fried breakfast. Very friendly staff who make you feel very welcome"
32,Excellent choice of breakfasts. Lovely cafe with friendly service. Really close to travel lodge city centre. Good value too.
33,"Was wondering down London with my daughter when I stumbled across this lovely cafe. It’s aesthetically pleasing on the outside, and immediately caught my eye. It is a traditional English cafe, with the inside being just as nice on the outside. Loads of choices to pick from on the menu, and even though it was very busy, the food arrived promptly. Very fresh and delicious. Everyone seemed happy with their meal in the cozy environment. Will definitely visit again and recommend to anyone and everyone. Thanks Nora☺️ see you soon."
34,"3 of us visited for breakfast on each of the 3 mornings we were in the area. Very handy for Travelodge residents.  Extensive menu, something for everyone, served by friendly obliging staff. The Potato Hash was wonderful.  We would definitely return when next in the area."
35,"Comfortable and friendly cafe with lots of choice on the menu, including good veggie and vegan options. We will return."
36,I come at least once per week here and I am always welcome. The food is amazing and the customer is excellent I recommand 100%
37,Had a bacon and sausage baguette for breakfast. Good quality food and a perfectly sized portion for a fair price. Coffee is nice as well. Will be back
38,"In London for a long weekend, and always stay at the PI at Aldgate. Looking up TA to see were there any cafe's locally, and Nora come out tops !!  An amazing find just off Middlesex St, ( the far end of '' Petticoat Lane ) a warm welcome, superb coffee, and wow the breakfast. First day I gave the poached eggs and salmon, and returning on the Monday just went for poached egg and bacon. First class produce well presented. Must mention too the '' Freshly sqeezed orange juice '' and it IS ....  Long to return when next in London, in October for a concert"
39,Perfect place for breakfast. There is lots of choice and everything was very tasty. Full cooked breakfasts are around £8 and they have smaller options which are pretty big! E.g. my wife ordered toast with eggs and bacon for around £4. The drinks are large and well made. The staff are very nice as well.
40,"Always great food especially the omelettes and breakfasts. Very good price and always quick. Off the main streets so not too busy but always a good stream of people enjoying their food and drinks. Friendly staff, food cooked to order and a sweet when you pay!!! Perfect! Love our regular weekly visits to Cafe Nora!"
41,I love this place. The food was excellent and the waitstaff was so nice. I highly recommend it if you are in the area.
42,"This small hidden gem has amazing food, fair prices, and very friendly staff. I’d definitely recommend stopping in for breakfast at this comfortable and cute little cafe! I ordered eggs and toast and the portion was large, delicious, and under 10 pounds. I’ll definitely be a returning costumer, great service!"
43,"Finding comforting locations to orient yourself to while having your needs met can be a daunting task when traveling abroad to unfamiliar territories. Fortunately, TripAdvisor is apt at assisting individuals to set their bearings when straying far from the nest. If you are looking for a wholesome breakfast amongst a cozy milieu, Nora Café will suit you well. The clean and unassuming atmosphere offers exceedingly friendly service. It is always reassuring when establishments are able to accommodate severe food allergies as well. I will certainly return."
44,"I was in Nora Cafe with my family, we enjoy a lot, the food was super nice and Elif was super friendly. When we back to London, we are going come again!!"
45,"Very friendly service! Both ordered paninis. Sandwiches were a bit more charred than we’d prefer-burnt really. I’m sure had we asked them to be remade, they would have without complaint. The waitress really seemed to care that her customers truly were enjoying their food, but we had tour tickets and needed to go. Would come back and try something else from menu. ❤️"
46,"Frequently visit for lunch. Great choice on the menu, good value and friendly service. Highly recommended and we always come back…"
47,"We visited the cafe yesterday for breakfast based on reviews and we were not disappointed. Lovely little cafe, big portions (in hindsight we could have ordered less) and the pancakes were a huge hit with my boys. I would highly recommend and would love to go back. Service was super friendly too."
48,"What a lovely little cafe this is, we were looking for somewhere for breakfast and found this on Trip Advisor, it lives up to the many 5 star ratings, there was loads of choice for breakfast. The food was very tasty and cooked fresh to order. It was so nice we came back the following morning too."
49,"Nora Cafe has become a must for breakfast every time we’re in London. The welcome, atmosphere and incredible breakfast knocks spots off any hotel breakfast - which we now give a miss! Highly recommend as part of your visit to London - definitely adds to the experience"
50,Always great service and of course wonderful food! Best cafe in the city! Breakfast lunch and dinner ;)
51,Amazing cafe near Brick Lane. Truly outstanding food at bargain ( for London ) prices. Had the breakfast hash which was a taste sensation. The ingredients were all top notch quality. My wife had the avocado mills smash which was nice but I did catch her envious glances towards my dish! Even the tea was lovely and only £1.50! Two great brekkies and drinks under £30. Can’t wait to go back !
52,Literally one of the best cafes where i had breakfast/ lunch! lovely staff and a nice environment :) Really cheap and delicious.
53,"Called at Nora's at lunchtime and was welcomed by very friendly staff. I ordered the breakfast potato hash and it was amazing... sublime.. I could talk about it at length because I just loved it. When I return to London it will be a priority to get back to this gem. My husband ordered chicken salad and he loved it. I am sure other dishes on the menu are incredible as well as dishes that other people had ordered looked lovely. Finally, I went to visit the toilet upstairs which was very clean."
54,"Elif was extremely accomodating to mine and my colleague's request to be sat upstairs, going that extra mile to make this experience an amazing one! Food and coffee was of course spot on, thank you very much!"
55,Great fresh food.. Polite and helpful staff.. Massive portions.. Can have a full English or spag bol or eggs benedict.. Really good variety.. Thanks and keep it up!
56,"Me and a friend were looking for places to eat breakfast in London and decided to try Nora Café due to its proximity to Liverpool Street and its positive reviews. We decided to eat our breakfast outside and were greated by the lovely smell of a spicy omelette from the gentleman behind us. We were also surprised by the low prices of the food items on the menu for a London Café and the large array of choices. Even before eating, reading the menu was an incredibly heartwarming experience. Many of the food items including bubble and squeak and fried bread reminded of the delicious breakfast my mum makes when I am at home. I ordered the set 2 breakfast with fresh orange juice and tea and my friend ordered the set 5 breakfast with a can of Tango and some pancakes. The waitress who took our order was very pleasant and attentive. When our drinks came, I was extremely presently surprised to find that the orange juice was freshly made and not from a carton as seen in most other cafés. This is exsacty how my mum makes freshly squeezed juice at home. When the breakfasts came, we found them to be tasty and really good value for money. The portion sizes were perfect and the price of the breakfasts also included bread and butter or toast. The fried bread was also especially delicious and was just like my mum's fried bread at home. We were both surprised that our bills came to £11 per person for everything we had, especially in London! For many years, I have been unable to find any café which serves a cooked breakfast as good as my mum's breakfast. I have however finally found a place which makes me feel like I am at a home away from home thanks to their delicious breakfasts. This hidden gem near the bustling city financial district of Moorgate and London Liverpool Street Station, serves up the best full English breakfast I have ever eaten in a Café. It reminds me of my mum's delicious breakfast at home and I urge anyone in London to go here, no matter where you are!"
57,"So we went for breakfast but everything I saw I wanted to try, Homemade meat pies, burgers, pizzas and more. The waitress was friendly and had a excellent rapport with her customers who appeared to be regulars. Most people seemed to be workers and not tourists. One man wanted a meat pie and our waitress assured him that she had reminded the cook to make them, so that there was one for him."
58,"Being a coffee enthusiast or should I say ADDICT. I have stopped at many cafes either just on a walkabout or around my working locations (I am a temp, so i've been to lots of areas in London). I have to say Nora Cafe provides the most superb service. Whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner, the food is cooked to everyones taste and so delicious and not forgetting the mention of coffee, well it certainly gets my highest vote. I have heard other customers comments to the staff whilst dining and they all seem happy and content with a full stomach. I have recommended this diner to everyone I know whom have visited this area and they have been grateful. Thank you to the owner, Elif and other staff for providing the best standard of dining."
59,Fantastic little cafe that serves some of the best food in the city. Me and my colleague go a few times a week for the omelettes and the smoothies. Well worth a visit.
60,"Another nice lunch at Nora Cafe, we come a couple of times a week as food and service all great, and good value for money. Pie and chips especially goes down a treat with my work colleague!!"
61,"Friendly, tasty, affordable! The café is small, but there's more seating upstairs. Vegetarian and vegan options exist. Had the vegetarian breakfast with home made bubbles and squeak, and it was well worth the price!"
62,"What a great place. Good food, reasonable prices, nice people and charming service. I highly recommend the hash browns and the Eggs Benedict Thanks !"
63,Just a short walk from the City Travelodge and I heartily recommend you get your breakfasts at this cafe. Lovely and efficient staff serve up a fine menu including all the breakfast favourites. Top quality ingredients at very keen prices for London. So good I went all three mornings of my stay. Opens Sundays too which is a bonus. Easily in my top all time cafes.
64,"Cafe Nora is excellent, what more can I say. We were staying at London City Travelodge and found cafe Nora the last time we visited London. We came here 3 mornings in a row for breakfast and it was excellent, sets you up for the day ahead. It is always a good sign when the locals are eating somewhere and this had business people in suits as well as workmen eating here and staff from Greater Anglia railways too. I am Coeliac and they had gluten free bread but by day 2 they had been out and purchased gluten free sausages too. Thank you Food is great, staff are brilliant and very friendly, Cafe Nora deserves to do well, they work hard and care about the customers. Thank you, we will be back."
65,"Definitely the best food and service around! I love coming here and enjoy they amazing service, food, and delicious food."
66,"Located in a worker neighborhood, good food, better energy and good prices....Highly recommended !!!"
67,"I regularly come here for English breakfast for brunch, it's delicious and really cheap. Inside is really cosy and the staff are super chill too :) Gets pretty busy from 12 to 13."
68,"Great staff, great food, great value, definitely use again when in London. Staff very friendly and always service with a smile."
69,"Great atmosphere. Good breakfast. Good service. Fast. Good range of food. Toilets as I start to expect in London, old and in need of a renovation, but clean enough and in working condition."
70,"Perfect east end gem. Worth a trip to London alone. Friendly and welcoming staff, beautiful and reasonably-priced food."
71,Very good spot for a nice meal and a quiet space. Friendly staff and caring service! Definitely would recommend
72,"So i found this little gem by accident, and im so glad i did, a wonderful quirky little place with an open fire and bookshelves, great choice of food, good value for money and even a freshly squeezed orange juice machine,great friendly service and run by the owner Nora who happily i got the chance to meet, i ordered an eggs royal type dish, it came beautifully presented and was so delicious o could've happily eaten another, my only grumble is i don't live or work nearby but il definitely be back, thank you ladies. Louise"
73,Beautiful spot with amazing staff. Breakfast is always on point. And it's an all day spot. 👌🏿😊😊☺
74,"We had a fantastic late breakfast here which really set us up for a day on foot. Really varied menu, fresh flavours and beautifully cooked. Generous portion sizes too. The smoothies were lovely. Very busy when we left so it deserves it’s Tripadvisor reviews. The staff are really friendly and attentive."
75,"We were exploring for a place to have breakfast near our hotel and came across this place, it was probably the best thing we discovered in London. Food was excellent, coffe was even better, owner and staff are very friendly, it was quiet and peaceful, it was like having a breakfast at home. Highly recommend."
76,"Great late breakfast experience. I love all day breakfast menu and this is the place you simply wanna visit for it. The atmosphere is very comfy, staff were som kind, smiling all the time. EverThing was clean. Order was served fast. Food was delicious. Pancakes are heaven. And most of all, coffee is DELICIOUS."
77,"Very nice cosy cafe, had a full cooked breakfast which was cooked lovely. Drinks served nice & hot. Very friendly staff. Best Cafe in the city."
78,"Amazing find! We were staying on the minories, so just a 5 minute walk. Welcoming, quirky decor and welcoming staff. Food was excellent and very reasonably priced. All day breakfast available. We had the avocado with poached eggs, delicious! Would highly recommend and will definitely return if we return to the area. Review wouldn't let me do 5 stars only 4? But definitely 5 stars from me!"
79,"Hits all the marks for a British cafe. Great food, quick, affordable, and a lovely fire place. 10/10"
80,My favourite cafe in London. It has the best full English served by such great people. Highly recommend.
81,"Well what can I say, just wonderful food served by wonderful people. Here with my family for a theatre weekend and I hate hotel breakfast and when there are places in London like this one, there’s really is no reason to pay over the odds.  I must visit if you are in London"
82,"Stayed in whitechapel righg next to aldgate tube station for a couple of nights and ventured here for breakfast on the first morning..  WE WERE NOT LET DOWN!  Norahs is a nice little cafe on the backstreets, and the first thing we noticed as we walked in was someones huge omellette, That was that, the wifes choice sorted cheese and mushroom omellette, it comes with chips and salad but she asked to swap those for toast which they gladly did., i had the mega breakfast, my sister had advocado on toast and her husband the traditional brekky.  The coffees were proper coffee and the orange juice squeezed in front of you.  All 4 of us cleared our plates and the prices were brilliant, we are from derby and we would really struggle to get that breakfast at that price here. We dont normally go back to the same place twice but it started our day so well that we went again the following morning and once again, brilliant.  Staff all friendly, location is clean and not a greasy spoon smell as you walk in either.  If back in that area we will deffo 100% be going again.  Many thanks"
83,"Brilliant food, tea, orange juice and service. Needed good quickly and they were really friendly and quick. Exactly what we love to see."
84,"Great small café in the Spitalfields area of London. They have absolutely wonderful staff who are always happy to help, the food is great (with the American pancakes being a standout) and the menu varied enough to cover whatever mood you’re in, especially hangovers. We ended up going twice in as many days, and I’ll absolutely visit when next in London. Hopefully they open up in Edinburgh too soon!"
85,"I can't say anything different, wonderful cafe, wonderful friendly staff, nice food, well cooked and not a spot of grease on the plate, this is not a regular greasy spoon is far far better"
86,"Best breakfast, coffee and service in London. Staff were very friendly and the food was incredible too. Go you will enjoy it. *****"
87,"Another lovely meal from Cafe Nora, this is Anatolia Chicken Grilled. Good menu, great customer service."
88,"I've lost count of how many visits we've made to this amazing little cafe since our first visit at the end of October last year. It's such a great find, we've really enjoyed the English breakfasts, potato hash dishes and omelette, and the coffee is amazing. The staff are so friendly and hardworking, and always smiling . We will carry on visiting even though we do live a good few miles away"
89,After half an hour of searching for a cafe we found Cafe Nora and it was the best decision we made!  The breakfast food that we got was both amazing in taste and in pricing!  It was our first time visiting and we were met with nothing but the best hospitality and once again BEST FOOD!!  I highly recommend Cafe Nora if you are in the area and if you aren’t THEN COME!!
90,My boyfriend and I were searching for a cafe in the area that would do nice full English breakfasts. We decided to give this cafe a chance since it was our first visit and we weren’t disappointed! We ordered 2 mega full English breakfasts and we left feeling full and very happy with our experience! Thank you for having us!
91,"The staff were welcoming and family friendly, good atmosphere. Staff were helpful to us and served lovely cake."
92,"Best cafe in London, great staff/owners who never forget you (I owe them some flowers) and always welcome you with a warm smile. The food is amazing every time, and priced nicely so it’s well worth it. 10/10 every time, highly recommended."
93,"Sublime ! Would recommend 10/10. The breakfast hash was fantastic. The staff are super friendly and helpful, and the fresh orange juice was a touch! Muy bien"
94,Honestly the best breakfast you can get in the area (especially their English breakfasts!) - you definitely won’t leave hungry. Staff are always so lovely and friendly and it’s always a pleasure to visit!
95,"I arrived very late, really they had cloaed, but opened the doors to me anyway! Nornwlly quite vibey with regular customers.. Photos are empty as it everyone else had left!  Really lovely cozy cafe, with welcoming owners apways around and kind staff:)  Low key great vegan brunch!!"
96,"Amazing comfort food, really good veggie options (green omelette is SO GOOD!) Lovely staff, me and my friend love coming here. Fresh orange juice is lovely!"
97,Very cozy and lovely staff! Make sure to order an orange juice rather than the Kinder minder milkshake (at least that’s the healthy choice the waitress steered me towards ;) )
98,"What an amazing place! Perfect neighborhood coffee shop. We had all sorts of breakfast options, I personally had the Full English breakfast and ir was a treat! Highly recommend it!"
99,"Popped in with my teenage son for lunch before a visit to Royal London Hospital, we travel from a fair distance away so we were both very hungry. Food was great, just what we needed! I had sausage and bacon roll (bacon was thick and very yummy) and son had chicken burger and chips. He ate his so fast I only managed to steal a couple of chips - fresh and not at all greasy. Staff were lovely and cheerful, decor great and cafe spotlessly clean. Really relaxed vibe, just what we needed. We give this 10/10 and will be back when we have next hospital visit!"
100,I was looking for restaurants in London and I am so thankful I found this place! Amazing food and service as well as atmosphere (nice cosy cafe). Definitely would recommend to anyone visiting Whitechapel or London.
101,"We stayed in the Travelodge nearby and this was within a very close walking distance. Breakfast was reasonably cheap and delicious! (And coffee and toast was included). Place is only small, and full of builders when we arrived but managed to get a seat and service was quick. I had the vegan breakfast, which was incredibly tasty! They also have standard breakfast, veggie option, bubble and squeak etc! They also have a machine for freshly squeezed Orange juice."
102,"We were staying at the local travelodge this weekend and wanted something for breakfast. We stumbled on this amazing cafe and, despite the fact that there were 7 of us, space was made for us and we started to look at the menu. What an extensive menu there was! Each of us had the most amazing breakfast - from those who wanted poached eggs and avocado, to those who wanted heavenly chocolate pancakes, to those who wanted the full works English breakfast. It was so good, and so reasonable, that we returned on our second day for more - each ordering something different again! We can't recommend them highly enough and will definitely return on our next visit into the big smoke. Highly recommended."
103,Cosy little cafe at the end of Pettycoat Market. Staff were welcoming and friendly. Food was really good. We ordered the Breakfast Hash and an Omlette which I wouldn't hesitate ordering again. The freshly squeezed Orange Juice was delicious! We arrived around 9am and got a table no problem. But it got busier and people started to wait towards 10am.
104,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and food made to my personal preference! They also have games to play while you wait 😊"
105,"Lovely food and friendly staff , great spot for a English breakfast and fresh squeezed orange is a must have."

107,"Really nice atmosphere, with good, decent staff and just really good food, unpretentious and relaxed."

115,"Went in to have the Breakfast Hash and it was great ..a Delicious meal! That wasn't the best part...a month ago I lost my cufflinks, it turns out that I had left them in this cafe. It was very thoughtful that they kept them, and amazing that they recognised me. These are some really good people!"
116,We pop in once a week for breakfast before work and the food is always good and service great. Definitely recommended
117,Very tasty food and friendly staff. The menu has a lot to choose from and the prices are great. Would recommend!!
118,Vegan brunch was extremely well done. The prices are very reasonable and the staff were extremely accommodating to switching parts of the brunch. No complaints.
119,"Went here for breakfast while on a business trip and the food, service and coffee were all amazing! Going back tomorrow!"
120,We popped in here last Sunday following a trip advisor review. Breakfast was so good we had to come back for more. Fantastic little cafe
121,"Fantastic breakfast, great customer service and very friendly staff. Food came out very quickly and 100% eat here again!!"
122,"Had an amazing breakfast, Eggs Deluxe (poached eggs, salmon, smashed avocado, benedict) and mega breakfast, lovely fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection and the fresh orange juice was delicious, friendly, and attentive service, highly recommend."
123,"Discovered this little gem of a cafe during our visit to London for a birthday celebration. We were both hungry and looking for a quality breakfast - we found it at Nora's. The cafe has a cosy, welcoming feel, the staff are friendly and attentive and the food freshly cooked to order. I cannot recommend Nora's highly enough."
124,Lovely staff great food and service will visit again very friendly and helpful very clean food very nice
125,"Best little cafe in London! I love this little place. The food is always outstanding, the service is personal and charming, the vibe is mellow warm and classy, the prices are great value because the portions are generous and the flavours always add a bit of interesting fabulousness to standard dishes.  I always get the eggs benedict and mocha for breakfast, which comes with a bit of dark green salad, plum tomato, and other yummy stuff on the side, while the eggs are perfectly poached sitting on top of smoked bacon or ham, with hollandaise sauce and herbs. More flavourful and interesting than the same dish served anywhere else.  At lunch, the Burger Blue is my favourite. Cheesy, great bun and fresh meat, side salad, sauces and fries/chips. Perfect!  Try other fresh orange juice, made in the machine which slices the oranges to order. Or the smoothies, all delicious!  The staff here are lovely. The music will calm your nerves and relax you on even your most stressful day. The decor is friendly, intimate, not pretentious just warm charming and personal.  Nora's cafe has become my favourite, obviously."
126,Amazing service and great vegan breakfast. The sausage was so good I actually had to double check it wasn’t meat!
127,"Always great food, and service with a friendly smile! My go to for breakfast in the city get the full English"
128,"Authentic cafe in Petticoat Lane Market serving great coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and really well executed breakfast staples at decent prices. Service is very friendly and efficient."

131,Had a great Breakfast in this lovely English cafe. A good selection of breakfast with some lovely additions such as bubble n squeak. Cannot recommend enough.
132,"We happened on this place when staying in Shoreditch this morning and so enjoyed it. The food is excellent, the service friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend!"
133,"What a gorgeous little place, such lovely staff and incredible food. They were so attentive and friendly and just after a couple of visits remember what we like already!!! The food is SO delicious and there is something for everyone.  Honestly such a hidden gem and literally will be going everyday."
134,This place is just incredible - they do the best breakfast in the area for an insanely cheap price - we live around the corner and come about 3 times a week (sometimes more)  Not to mention the coffee is also the most delicious thing I’ve ever tasted!
135,This place is just unreal…..has everything you would need and want in a small run cafe. It really is a hidden jem. Had the best Spanish hash brunch…..:this place is certainly up there for me! Can’t wait to return. Thank you NORA 😊.
136,"What a fantastic little gem Nora's Cafe is. Hidden away in the hustle and bussle of the metropolis, Nora's Cafe provides the comfort food that everybody would appreciate. There is something for everyone! I had the Turkish Potato Hash and it was amazing! The service is fantastic. I'm always going to return back to this wonderful hidden gem.  p.s please try the homemade apple crumble! What a treat!"
137,"This cafe is one of the most friendly cafes in London, it’s atmosphere is very nice and I has a chicken burger which was very scrumptious and exquisite, I would give the cafe 10/10."
138,It was an exciting and pleasant experience. The general atmosphere of the cafe was simply spectacular. Would recommend!
139,"I had a mouth watering burger that quenched my hunger. It lighten my life for the single day I have gone. I wish to go again and again and again. But I am not worthy to experience again. The canned Fanta was most delicious as it was perfectly stored at the optimum temperature which little cafes can do. The service was also exquisite and quick. They were also incredibly nice and entertaining, the music was also very good it opened my ears to a new genre of music."
140,Brilliant breakfast could fault it. I had the Breakfast hash and my wife had a sausage and bacon roll. Great portions and great taste. If only we lived closer. Well worth a visit.
141,Great breakfast and coffee! Very generous portion sizes too! Staff were very friendly and efficient highly recommend
142,"We tried Nora’s cafe after reading the 5* reviews on Trip Adviser and we weren’t disappointed. We received a warm and friendly welcome, the menu is superb and we enjoyed a delicious home cooked breakfast with fresh fruit smoothies and coffee. It really was a first class experience and on future stays in London, we will book room only at the hotel and visit Nora’s again! Highly recommend."
143,"Me and the missus are spending a couple of days in our lovely capital city and stumbled in to this little gem of a café. Service was great, our 2 full English breakfast were better, the coffee was delicious and the prices reasonable. Love it!!"
144,"Spotlessly clean, great food & drinks, friendly staff and reasonable prices. Their all day breakfasts, coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice are fantastic. I will definitely return."
145,"When I entered today, it was really busy. Over this summer I have been going around London with my friends, so we decided to stop by this cafe that seemed popular near the area. My friends and I ordered our breakfasts and, although the cafe was full, Nora and her team worked professionally, very nicely and were very welcoming to us. The food came out delicious and warm, despite the busy kitchen that I could hear, and it was really fresh which really brightened up our morning. I would recommend what I had; Eggs Royale and the fresh orange juice. I'll most likely come again on my next trip! I knew I had to leave a review to share this experience with everyone! Thanks Nora!"
146,"Last Sunday, İ visited Nora Cafe by myself. By looking on the outside, İ could already tell that it was going to be amazing. İ ordered this amazing pancake, honestly one of the nicest İ’ve had in a long time. The inside was very cozy and warm, which set the perfect atmosphere. On top of that, the staff was incredibly sweet, and nice to talk to. Definitely recommend, and will soon visit again."
147,"It was incredible experience for us , delicious coffee , yummy dishes. you should try smoothies. The chef came with a smile and asked if we liked the food, she was very interested."
148,I came to have breakfast at Nora's cafe recently and i loved it! A very nice atmosphere and delicious coffe. Although the place could be cleaner.
149,"Noras was really good value for money! Had a full english and set 4 for £14, both including a hot drink. The food was really tasty and staff were lovely. Atmosphere was also very pleasant."
150,"We were staying nearby last weekend and on reading the reviews thought we would give this cafe a visit. We had breakfast on Saturday morning -both ordering the English breakfast and then returned again on Sunday morning when I swapped to the English Potato hash. Both mornings we received excellent friendly service from our witnessed but Nora also made a point of coming out of the kitchen and chatting to us and making sure everything was ok. T The food was freshly cooked, plentiful and so tasty with a great menu where anyone can get food to eat -there are Turkish and mediterranean choices, healthy, vegan and vegetarians options. On Saturday one table were requesting changes to their breakfast because they eat only halal meat and on Sunday a Jewish gentleman asked for his breakfast to be cooked in a particular way, nothing was too much trouble. Absolutely no faults to be found. I even used the loo upstairs on Sunday and it was immaculately clean. If we lived nearby it would become a local."
151,"Staff are nice and very kind. Great for brunch and english breakfast. You get the best of quality and quantity, all for a reasonable price."
152,"I use the Nora Cafe every day and it's amazing. They have the friendliest staff and the best food! Nothing is too much trouble and everybody is always smiling, chatty, and friendly ..I would recommend the Nora Cafe to everybody!"
153,"I always come here near to their closing times and they still serve me passionately without any complaints. top services received from everyone and the food is AMAZING!! try out their panini, club sandwich and most importantly their chocolate fudge cake, they are to die for"
154,"Fabulous find, amazing food. Visited with my teenages on a busy Sunday morning. Welcomed us upstairs, where we browsed the vast menu. So much breakfast choice especially for the vegetarians among us which is refreshing. Fabulous food, reasonable priced,great service by the friendly staff and a lovely conversation with Nora herself. Little things mean a lot and the complimentary chocolates and bananas were so appreciated. If you enjoy good homecooked food prepared with care this is your place. You won't regret it."
155,"Nora and her team make every visit wonderful and every plate delicious. No nonsense great food, especially breakfast"

169,My friend and I were staying at a nearby hotel but after reading the reviews for Nora’s Cafe I called to see if I needed to book a table for breakfast. I was told that it wasn’t necessary but on arrival was surprised that Nora remembered my name which made us instantly feel at home. There’s a really nice ambience about this place but the stars of the show are the staff and the food. Visit there and you won’t be disappointed. Thanks Nora - your poached eggs and avocado were perfect.
