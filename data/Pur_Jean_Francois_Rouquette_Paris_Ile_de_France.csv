We sat right next to the open kitchen and that was a great experience too. Everyone was very welcoming and kind, and it was great to be able to speak to chef as well. Would definitely recommend this place, and would love to visit again in the future. Thank you for an amazing experience!"
1,"Excellent, high quality dining experience. If you are looking for an outstanding dinner experience, then this is the place!!! The food was exactly what one expects from a great French Chef. Plates with the perfect combination of contrasting flavors, each one served more elegantly than the next. We have traveled the world over the past 40 years, and this was clearly one of our best overall dining experiences. The staff are equally attentive and cater to your each and every need! The service is very well orchestrated, and done in a sophisticated and elegant manner - top notch!! We also had the wine pairing, which was also delightful."
2,"In Pur, I had one of my favorite dinners ever. The multi-course ""Carnet de voyage"" tasting menu with complementary wines was what I ordered. It was excellent! All of the courses were delectable, artfully presented, and exquisitely paired with wines. Excellent service was provided. Nina and Camille were really kind, considerate, and professional. This place is fantastic for a classy evening in Paris, in my opinion."
3,"My fiancé and I had dinner in between Christmas and New Year's Eve on our engagement trip in Paris and it was a wonderful experience. We indulged in the special holiday 9 course tasting menu and also splurged on the wine pairing. All of the food was excellent - the flavors were complex yet not overpowering, and every single dish was delicious. The service was also outstanding - our server was charming and attentive yet not overbearing, and explained every dish in an approachable manner. The wine pairing was also excellent and the sommelier, I believe his name was James, was terrific. The restaurant manager, I believe his name was Jean-Baptiste, was also warm and hospitable, and allowed us to take photos in the kitchen after the meal. This was a memorable experience and I wouldn't hesitate to come back. My only nitpick (and it is a very small one!) is that the 9-course meal was a bit too much food. All of the dishes were delicious and rich, but they were all healthy serving sizes. However, everything was so delicious that I did end up eating it all (and gaining a waist size)."
4,What a treat. Enjoyed the 6 course chefs menu. With such attention to details the craft on the plate was exotic. What a lovely experience with such service. great selection of wines. Open 5 nights only. Reserve in advance.
5,"When my wife & I arrived for dinner at PUR, we were warmly greeted, and this was the start of our most romantic evening in Paris. This is fine dining with exquisite dishes. The staff was professional yet extremely friendly along with the wine steward who helped me make the perfect selection to complement our seafood and meat entrees. Overall, our meal was outstanding…it is the Best!!! We highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to returning."
6,Amazing gastronomic journey with high end service!!! Many thanks to Mr Romanos (the sommelier) for his support and wine proposal. Must visit!!!
7,Our favorite meal while we were in Paris. Everything about the experience was amazing from beginning to end. The food was all beautifully prepared and delicious. The wine pairings went perfectly with the dishes. The service was top notch. Even the restaurant itself is a unique and fun environment to be dining in. We will definitely be going back when we're in Paris.
8,One of the best fine dining experiences we have had! We opted for the 6 course menu and it was perfect from the beginning to the end. Apart from the taste and presentation what stood out was also the smooth service and timing. We did not have to wait long for the next dish to come in spite of the fact that the restaurant was full. Overall fantastic and we will for sure go again.
9,"The staff was professional yet warm and extremely knowledgeable. They explained in detail every course as well as the wine pairing. The food was inventive with seasonal flavors that were well balanced from start to finish, the desserts were delicate and seductive."
10,"I guess it should be good at those prices; but the service was tremendous and everything was truly “special” The six course dinner came with four amuses bouches, great rolls. Langoustine scallops squab etc. Prune and plum desserts to die for. We thought the wine flight was worth the money. But.... Wish Paris restaurants would ease up on what they charge for bottled water. The mark up is too much. Hard to see how a country so fixated on what’s “green” wants to waste money on bottled water. But i felt it was too tacky to ask for “une carafe d’eau” at a joint like this. Not many parisians. Mostly tourists."
11,"C'était parfait! We were looking forward to the 6 course/4 wine pairing experience, and it did not disappoint. Everything was wonderful - the food, the wine, the atmosphere and the wonderful service. Thank you for making my birthday so memorable!"
12,Amazing dinner! The meal was so interesting & one of a kind. The service was top notch. We could not have had a better experience.
13,"We had a fanatic meal at Pur that went way beyond our expectations. After a week of fine dining in Reims we were not sure we could fit in another large meal on our last night in Paris, but we are so glad we persevered! We opted for à la carte to make the meal a bit lighter and both chose the sea bass which was cooked perfectly and a really good sized portion. The cheese trolly, for me, is always the highlight of a meal in France and this was no exception, a vast selection to choose from. The service, atmosphere, food and wine were perfect, and all staff were very welcoming and genuinely attentive. We visited for my birthday and the little touches to make it special really made my night. Thank you so much to all at Pur for a fantastic and memorable birthday meal. We would certainly love to return and try the tasting menu!"
14,"This was a special occasion meal and we were not disappointed. Absolutely blown away by the food, the service and cannot recommend highly enough! We had the 9 courses and every dish was faultless and so was the wine. We were so well looked after, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you so much."
15,Me and my fiancé came here a couple of nights ago for a celebratory evening meal. The service was second to none and the food was absolutely impeccable. The atmosphere was perfect; not too quiet and not too loud. The staff were extremely friendly and met our every need. We did the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairing which we would definitely recommend. Would 100% come back here again.
16,Absolutely awesome experience at Pur. We had the 9 -course menu with the wine pairing. Food was excellent and service was exquisite. First wine was maybe not for us but the rest paired nicely with the menu items. An experience highly recommended.
17,On my last trip to Paris I had the chance to dine at this top of the line restaurant. It really is the top of the top.
18,"Wow! We wanted somewhere special to celebrate our silver wedding, and Pur' certainly was special. This really is fine dining: exciting food in elegant surroundings, with highly professional front-of house staff. They were efficient, yet amiable, witty and completely put us at our ease. This was the most expensive meal we have ever had, but we don't regret that for one moment."
19,The service and the foods are top rated. I ordered the 6 couse menu and it’s fantastic. The quality of the foods are outstanding.Must try in Paris
20,"Excellent, nothing else to say - Service, Ambient, Location, Food - The experience was fantastic - Prepare the wallet though :)"
21,"Good- but overrated… We looked forward to our dinner at Pur , but were disappointed in the menu. There were only four entrées to choose from and one was a cheese platter. The other entrée choices were sea bass , wyagu beef and sweet breads. My husband wanted none of them however he chose the wyagu beef. The sauce for the beef was excellent and he enjoyed it however at €135 it should be more than very good . I ordered the Seabass and found it adequate. The risotto with curry that came with the beef also had an excellent sauce. Some of the servers, including James and Amin, were very good. Leopold never brought the citrus vinaigrette I requested and seemed to completely forget it. He also had to be asked to serve us bread. There were many “extras” that were provided at no charge,but being very gourmet,required a receptive palate. I loved the artichoke appetizer bite with curry,but my husband didn’t care for any of them. We ordered a la carte,but with a €90 bottle of wine ( which was the least expensive Bordeaux on the menu) and coffee, our bill before tip was €333. We are world travelers and have stayed at some of the best hotels. Overall, I would give the food a B-. My husband gave it a much lower rating than that. If we had ordered the six course fixed menu with wine, the bill would have been well over €600. You would have had the same four entrees as well. Interesting experience, but we would never go back."
22,"The team at Pur made my 30th birthday an amazing affair. From arrival the service was second to none, and to have a table with full view of the kitchen was a spectacle to behold. The team are as you can imagine a well oiled machine, and you can see the passion both in the kitchen and on the plates. The dishes each held their own magic with the balance of flavours as you would expect perfect. I would highly recommend visiting if you are looking for an experience like no other in a breathtaking setting as you'd expect in Paris.  A huge thanks to the team again, we shall be back.  Amy"
23,My wife and I had the privilege of eating at a handful of different Michelin starred restaurants ranging from one to three stars during our recent visit to Paris and London. Pur was our absolute favorite. Not to be missed!
24,"We dined with two friends, who are also critical foodies. The atmosphere, the gentle and attentive staff and excellent sommelier all contributed to the very pleasant and memorable dining experience. Chef JF Rouquette personally introduced some of his courses, which added an extra cachet . We choose the 6 course signature menu. Without a doubt , each course was delicately prepared and embodied the chef’s philosophy on fine dining courses. The pastry chef’s rhubarb creation resembles a sushi dish and is a feast for the eye as well as a real delicacy. This will become one of my favorite places in Paris for personal and special business events. Pur deserves more than 1 star Michelin."
25,It was absolutely lovely evening. The staff was so kind and friendly even though we arrived slightly late.  The textures and flavors were exquisite.  Would definitely visit again.
26,"It was the most romantic evening with my wife!! Our sommelier, James, and the staff were absolutely wonderful attending to our every need!! Must dining experience if you are in Paris!!"
27,"What a great meal and experience. The food was terrific, and James the sommelier served up the perfect wine pairings. Bravo Pur!"
28,So kind nice and warm service specially from James the sommelier! Definitely will come back Thank you
29,"Amazing restaurant, amazing food! Amazing service..James the Chef Sommelier made this dinner excellent - we defiantly come back."
30,Visited during our trip to Paris and elected to have the 9-course experience with wine pairing. What an amazing experience this was. Everything that was prepared was done so by what seemed like a cooking god. I don't even like Foie Gras or Fennel and I ate every single bit of the food that was prepared. Overall it was about a 4.5-hr experience. It did not even feel that long though because the staff was always there for us to refill our glasses the moment they were empty. By far the best dining experience I have ever had.
31,"amazing experience, excellent food, flawless service. Special thank you to James Barnett Chef Sommelier for an incredible wine pairing and personalized experience. A must!"
32,"Outstanding ! No words ! Really worth visiting ! One of the top ten restaurants in Paris that continues surprising ; amazing cuisine, impeccable and fresh service , innovative patisserie = Just Perfect!"
33,Excellent atmosphere - food exquisite. Service was impeccable. A definite treat whike in Paris. The 6 course menu was perfect.
34,We were in this restaurant with our management “ vecchia osteria Piran “ from Slovenia. We have tried incredible experience. The 9 courses menu was amazing fantastic and the staff very professional. We will return. Congratulation
35,"We had a wonderful and memorable meal at Pur’ in October to celebrate a wedding anniversary. Since most members of our party were quite interested in food and cooking, we reserved the chef’s table and ordered the 9-course tasting menu with matching wines. The service was impeccable. Not everyone in our party spoke French, but the wait-staff switched from French to English with great fluency. The menu was especially interesting because it included certain rare ingredients such as white truffles and black lemon; the chef Jean-François Rouquette showed them to us and explained their provenance. Sitting at the chef’s table allowed an insight into the workings of a gourmet kitchen all the while enjoying a delicious meal. We were at the restaurant for 3 ½ hours and did not notice the time pass. We are sure that Pur’ will soon receive a second Michelin star."
36,"Sometimes we found the Michelin star in France a question mark who they earn it but in this restaurant it is clear. The 9 course dinner was excellent and the Wagyu beef is wonderfull, when you taste you want to go back to Kyoto.. The crockery where the dishes are served match with it. Prthaps it is a idea to give the guest a menu when leaving but hte sweets and cake was also wonderfull.Thanks to the staff and sommelier for a nice evening."
37,Remarquable service;great wine list;succulent refined meal; Our evening with Pur was most memorable and pleasant in every way
38,"I had a dinner at Pur' restaurant during my stay at Park Hyatt Paris Vendome hotel. I appreciate an excellent service, great dishes quality and ability to see kitchen work. I had a three-courses-menu dinner and except three main dishes kindly got a few complimentary ones. Many thanks to Jean-Francois Rouquette and colleagues for great impressions."
39,"Sometimes you are hesitant to test a 2 star-Michelin that is nested in a 5 star hotel...we nevertheless took the chance and were amazed by the whole experience: Warm welcome, efficient, friendly, relaxed but classy service during the whole meal. Fine appetisers, and a six-course menu that offered great tastes and used high-quality products. Cheese options are limited but quality is great. Deserts were fine. In terms of price, the six-course menu is very reasonable. The wine list is large but rather expensive....A perfect meal with one suggestion: please change this horrible music!"
40,"First and foremost, the food here was amazing. If you're looking for a fine dining experience in Paris, Pur' is excellent. It is absolutely worth the price(s); my favorite dish was personally the steamed pollock, which is probably one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had in my life. No dish disappointed. The atmosphere and the decor was beautiful and the servers were very professional, efficient, and attentive.  However, I did have one major issue, and it significantly affected my experience at this restaurant. I went here with my (gay male) friend, and the staff assumed we were a couple -- which is not the problem, as this happens to us all the time. The issue was that, BECAUSE they assumed we were a couple, I noticed that I was treated differently than my friend. For example, I was given a menu without prices, while my friend was given one with prices. And the staff consistently deferred to my friend, even when I spoke (the only time I recall the staff specifically paying attention to me was when I was ordering for myself). I understand that this might be how the restaurant traditionally treats parties they perceive as couples, and perhaps some people may not mind this treatment, but personally, I felt incredibly uncomfortable. I understand that the assumption that the man pays for a date/is the breadwinner/dominant partner in a heterosexual relationship is a widespread, societal norm that is not the fault of this restaurant in particular, but I have never encountered it so codified before. Even if I had come here with a partner, I would not have appreciated being treated under these outdated assumptions of gender roles.  Again, the food, atmosphere, and service was exquisite, but I hesitate to say I had a wholly satisfactory experience because of this issue. I am certainly not the only diner who has felt or will feel the way that I did about the way I was treated, and I hope this review is informative for both potential diners and for the restaurant in how diners' experience could be improved."
41,Elegant restaurant with contemporary decor and a beautiful open kitchen. We had the 6 course menu + wine pairing. Every dish was perfection. Service was professional and friendly without being stuffy despite the hotel setting. My husband thought the fish dish was one of the best he'd ever eaten in his life. Dessert was the weakness dish for us but still good. In our opinion this restaurant deserves more than 1 star. One of the most enjoyable dining experiences we've had in Paris.
42,"We have been invited to this magnificent restaurant, French gastronomy is a must, a real treat with very high quality wines"
43,"An amazing dining experience in the middle of Paris. Really attentive, generous and skilled servers. We tried the 8 servings of the “trip menu” and it was astounding. Definitely recommendable to anyone wanting a classic Michelin experience."
44,"About last night we had one of the best dinner , we dined many Michelin star restaurant all over the world but when you dine one Michelin star and one of the top ten restaurant in Paris as expected our expectations was high and pur was way way more than our expectations the food the wine and the service !! We had 8 course and wine pairings every plate was amazing and wine I can’t even explain !! Thank you everyone at pur to make our 25th anniversary that much special. !! I truly a gastronomic experience!!"
45,"We went for dinner last night and it was incredible. Having spent a long time researching which of the many Michelin restaurants to go to in Paris, we decided to choose this one and it was beyond amazing. I couldn’t recommend it enough. We had the 6 course dinner with matching wines - the staff were so knowledgeable, the food was out of this world, and the wines were matched so perfectly. Thanks for looking after us so well, I couldn’t recommend it enough."
46,"Having wanted to dine at Le Pur for a while we eventually found the time and a good reason to go. We had the 6 course tasting menu with the wine pairing and all I can say is wow. The food was perfect, cooked to perfection and the wines that the sommelier chose were spot on. Service was just right and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. We agreed that the restaurant deserves more than just one star too. Pass by the hotel bar before for a great cocktail for the whole experience."
47,"We went to celebrate our anniversary, the attention and all the little details made you fall in love with the place. Dishes are expectacular"
48,"valentines meal in this stylish restaurant. possibly the best food we have ever eaten. it certainly is not cheap and i think the water and coffee should have been included in the 595 euro price tag for two, but non the less the food was served with style presented with style and tasted absolutely fantastic"
49,"Service, location and food were unlike anything else I have experienced before.  Ideal for very special occasions, birthday/anniversary  5*"
50,"We came for a fantastic birthday dinner for 4. We could not have been better looked after. The setting and service was just lovely. The food was superb. We had the set menu and, whilst expensive, it was central Paris after all!, we thought it was worth the price for the quality of the food and the overall experience. The standout for me was wagyu beef and the Brittany turbot, whereas for my wife it was the cheese board (amazing!) and for my son the special chocolate cake made especially. We will definitely be returning, when money allows."
51,"If you are a true foodie who loves the quintessential dining experience, this restaurant is for you. The dining room is beautiful, lighting is perfect, and the kitchen is open so you can see the wonders of your table being prepared. We ordered the eight course tasting menu with the wine pairings, and all was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. The sauces were all subtly seasoned (no additional seasoning needed here), distinctive, and pulled every dish together. I haven’t mentioned the service-impeccable, attentive and friendly. My cousin and I prefer to speak in French (you have to practice!) and they were very tolerant of our efforts. Eight courses can seem daunting, but all were sized perfectly and left you in anticipation of the next. Many thanks to the entire staff at Pur, for a memorable experience-by the time we come back you will have your second star!"
52,Our Dinner at Pur' was the best meal my son and I have ever had. We went to Paris for only 4 days and we are so happy this was the way we ended our trip. we both love to cook so we were overwhelmed at the presentation and and the food. The service was amazing and they customized the 8 course tasting meal as I do not eat fish and honestly it couldn't have been better. This whole experience is one we will never forget.
53,"This was truly a Parisian experience. The food was excellent, the service was flawless, and the atmosphere was very welcoming. Will definitely dine here again."
54,This was my second time at Pur'. My boyfriend and I both had the larger tasting menu with the wine pairing. The staff was very attentive and plated and utensils moved like a well tuned orchestra. The food was phenomenal and the wine pairing was fantastic. The cheese trolley was such a highlight and we can say we had the best selection of cheeses we've ever had. This restaurant needs more than 1 star. Can't wait to be back.
55,"We ate at Pur' in December as part of a 5 night trip to Paris to see the Leonardo Exhibition at the Louvre. We also dined at Epicure, Apicius, Joel Robuchon and L'Ardoise. We had a wonderful meal at Pur'. We had the 6 course tasting menu. Dishes were all interesting with nice Far East influences. The crab dish and the scallops were excellent. We were made very welcome. Given the chance to change our table to allow us to view the kitchen and the chef's final inspection of each dish. We thoroughly recommend this restaurant for excellent food, service and value for money (expensive but very much worth it). If interested Pur' and Apicius were our favourite restaurants. Slightly disappointed with Robuchon and even more so with Epicure. We had been to L' Adoise 3 years ago and it did not disappoint on our return."
56,"On entering the dining room, we were struck by the soft pleated folds of the fabric walls echoing the restaurant’s location on the elite fashion street Blvd St Honore. Then we were welcomed by our charming server Guillaume who turned out to be the best we’ve had in any top restaurant in the world. And the sommelier Julia recommended a truly superb wine that was less pricey than the original wine we requested that was not available. This exceptional service was matched by a meal full of delicious inventive dishes including several light foam creations. The dark chocolate dessert was so spectacular i hardly dared to eat it but it was as delicious as it was beautiful. Truly a magical dining experience in all dimensions!"
57,"I booked this Michelin star restaurant for my boyfriends birthday and everything was perfect. Excellent customer service even before we had arrived. After I mentioned about our birthday celebration they wanted to make sure that we had an amazing time. We got their 8 courses tasting menu with wine pairing and in addition to this their lobster dish. Each dish was perfectly seasoned and cooked and very well presented. The service was excellent. The staff was very attentive and very helpful. When we visit Paris again we are definitely going to dine at this beautiful restaurant and most likely going to stay at their beautiful hotel as well. If we could give more stars we would, because this was the best Michelin star restaurant we have been to. Thank you for making our special day very special."
58,"The place is inside Hyatt. Extremely posh and expensive but for sure worth a visit. This is a gastronomic experience of a different level you unlikely to experience in your everyday life. The restaurant does not have windows - may be because view through the window may interfere with clients dining experience. When we arrived (8 pm) the place was almost empty but in one hour all tables were occupied though it was a regular Tuesday night. We did not go for the set menu neither did we go for wine pairing and decided to order a la carte. The food is excellent. It is not actually the dishes that we selected that excited us the most - it is the chef complements - they are amazing. Frankly I do not know how they do it - this is not food processing, this is food art. The price corresponds with the level of service and food quality - I guess that was the largest bill I ever paid for a meal for two. If you can afford it, go for it without hesitation."
59,"We celebrated my wifes birthday at Pur and had a wonderful dinner.The staff and their attention to detail,the presentation of of each and every course absolutely delicious we want to thank the restaurant for a wonderful evening.and are looking forward to our next dinning experience at PUR."
60,A fabulous Michelin star restaurant. The food and service was top notch couldn’t fault it. We chose the 8 course taster menu with wine flight...and left very full and got plenty of wine!
61,"Our third time here and I make no apologies for a third review, hoping it might encourage others to eat at this exceptional place. The food is outstanding, with a wonderful range of flavours across the tasting menu. The service is top-notch. The ambience is refined and peaceful. And I must add our thanks for the way the restaurant handled a misunderstanding over our booking, a response which showed how they value their clients. Can't wait to go back next year."
62,"This restaurant is wonderful. Perfect food, same with the service, the furniture, everything. We would like to live here and eat here every single day in our lives from now."
63,"This was an overall exceptional experience! The staff were attentive, friendly, and cheerful, and went above and beyond to make this a wonderful night! The service was excellent, our water glasses were never left empty and we never had to wait more than a few minutes between courses. The food was delicious and full of interesting flavours and combinations, and the portion sizes were surprisingly large given the number of courses. They even gave us a treat to take home with us at the end. The ambiance was very elegant and calm, creating a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere."
64,"The experience was worth every penny, this is among the best places I’ve ever had a meal. Having one Michelin star raises the expectations, but the restaurant’s crew delivered. Every dish was wonderful. We decided on the 6 course menu and opted out of the champagne and wine package, as it is too much to drink for us (and saves you 1/3 of the price), but had a couple of glasses of wine each instead.  Overall a very satisfying experience, I would go there again given the opportunity."
65,"A most wonderful experience of fine dining & superb service,We ordered the six course degustationning.. menu. The presentation and taste of the food was sensational. The culinary experience was most memorable as was the evening..Should you be in Paris for a special occasion,then this is the place to celebrate,"
66,"Took my mom on a vacation to Paris, Rome, and London, so we decided to have a nice dinner in Paris. We chose Pur and thoroughly enjoyed our experience!  We had the 6 course meal, which was more like 9 courses, including the chef's unique creations. EVERYTHING tasted wonderful, cooked to perfection. The presentation was excellent; I barely wanted to eat the food (just sit and look at it). We had two waiters, and a female server for our drinks. Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive, thoroughly and patiently answering any questions, given our very limited French.  The atmosphere is really classy, with a more contemporary style, but still, that French ambiance.  My mom can't stop talking about her experience, and why should she? It was amazing! We would absolutely return!"
67,Th eight course menu was flawless. Each one of them was different and served with a great wine selection. Great service and just and overall solid michelin star restaurant.
68,This restaurant is better than it’s rating. Service is outstanding. The prefix menus are extremely well done. Chef creates interesting preparations that highlight the main elements of each course.  This restaurant should be three stars.  Wonderful evening. Thank you.
69,"We celebrated our wedding anniversary here. It was an exquisite occasion, a genuine cut above anything we'd normally experience."
70,"We stayed at the Park Hyatt for 3 nights during our trip to France. My birthday happened to fall during our stay and we tried to get a table online but the restaurant was showing as fully booked. We emailed the hotel and they were able to confirm a reservation for us just a few nights before. Imagine our surprise when we showed up for dinner and the wonderful maitre d' escorted us to the Chef's table! We did the 7 course tasting with wine pairing but we couldn't keep track of what number we were on, very quickly. (There were so many extras!) I have some dietary limitations which the chef was able to work around, seemingly easily. With the entire kitchen on show, it was a delightful experience though very intimate at the chef's table. We were already impressed and pleased with every course that came out but when the Wagyu beef course came out- I may have cried some tears of joy because it was perfection in my mouth. I even halted the chef to tell him how amazing it was in the middle of the course. Every pairing was a classic match to the dominant flavors of each dish. The cheese course was just ridiculous. In the sheer quantity and selection. Delicious but that quantity is rough on the stomach of non French diners. The madelines and after dinner pastry they offered to pack up to have the next morning (we were so full!) and we were thankful we did!!! Those madelines were better than any other madeline I had ever had and that snail shell was perfectly executed laminated dough.  We are no strangers to multi course fine dining in NYC. This is the classic French dining experience and this was executed perfectly."
71,"First the food is far beyond wonderful. Second, the quality of service matches the food. Truly excellent! We had a truly „Lifetime Event“ dinner here on 15 September 2019. We had 6 in our party from Europe and the United States. The decor and atmosphere are stunning but not overwhelming. We felt as if we were in a nice warm home for a gourmet meal. We chose the Escape 6 course menu with wine pairing. Every single item was superb in presentation, taste, texture and overall marriage of flavors. The service was also truly „World Class“ The Chef, Jean François Rouquette is a honest to gosh genius and his team of Chefs make him shine even more! I can go on but you have to experience dinner here for yourself. It’s that awesome! Bravo!"
72,Being from San Francisco this is one of the most amazing meals we’ve ever had and we are big foodies you must go if you’re into the experience and amazing food the wine pairing was perfect!
73,"At Least once in life you should experience a Michelin star ⭐️ restaurant and it doesn’t get any better than Pur in Paris. Simply superb in all aspects. An elegant ambiance, unique delicious dishes and impeccable service are part of the total experience. You will not be disappointed.  After have a nightcap in the Hyatt patio to close out a perfect night."
74,I order just My favorite menu Albion Is Great . Beef is very fine. The Best is Chicken very soft . The dessert was Good . Milky sweenten. The service from staffs your never been met before.
75,"Excellent restaurant in central area off Palace Vendome. The service and attention to detail were fantastic and our every wish catered for. We selected the tasting menu with wine pairing and were not disappointed. The starters were sublime and each course set to tantalise and play with your tastebuds. The wines were well selected and paired perfectly to heighten the burgeoning flavours within the dish. At the end of the meal we were left extremely well fed, satisfied and cared for by the team. We look forward to a return."
76,"We had made a reservation for Sunday night almost 8-9 Wks prior - we went at our time reserved as I gotten a text from them and when we reached there she said our reservation was for next evening - and their “Fork company “which manages the reservations never notified them - & they kept blaming the reservation company - when we get the text we don’t know who it is coming from, we just assume it came from the restaurant, I had even called to confirm and it went on voice call - it was all in French - My mistake was I should have checked the date which their reservation site changed it - All in all - rude and totally disrespectful staff - We had to find another restaurant to eat -"
77,"The service was excellent, all the staff were extremely helpful to any questions or requests. The food was phenomenal, the Waygu steak was prepared perfectly. Also, the amuse-bouche the served throughout kept the entirety of the meal a unique and interesting experience. Despite the general theme being seafood, you will still find excellent alternatives if you wish. Was very happy with my experience."
78,"Been here for twice. Each time Pur' did not disappointed me. Every dish was exquisite & piece of art. Pur"" deserve more than one micheline. Thank you for the unforgettable memories."
79,We enjoyed a delightful meal here last night. The entire experience was a 10...from the moment we arrived.  We had the The Diary menu which was 8 courses.  My husband matched the wines. Each course was delightful and an explosion of flavours.  A culinary delight to savour. The service was kind and beautiful as well ad classy and discreet.  Definitely one of the 10 experiences.  My only criticisms are that there is not nearly enough protein in the main steak dish as I felt the portion was just too tiny. I was very hungry - and had to have extra bread. The other one was that the olive oil around the dessert made it quite bitter - probably not the best taste sensation but the strawberry and rhubarb dessert was sublime.  The beautiful lady at the front gave us a gift when we left - some little cakes which was a lovely touch.  Expect to pay a small fortune but it's a wonderful experience. Thank you
80,"Every year when we visit Paris we try to delight ourselves with a dinner at Pur’. It’s always a wonderful experience, we enjoy the special treatment and attention of the perfectly trained staff, we selected the 6 dishes menu with wine pairing. Every dish was fine, exquisite and beautifully presented. The atmosphere is elegant and calm. It’s a fine dining experience with a price tag on it but absolutely worth it. We will come back next year again, for sure."
81,I have had the pleasure of dining at all the 3 Stars in France and this is their equal. Everything from service to presentation and food was of the highest standards. I am sure Michelin will agree upon their further review.
82,"The restaurant Pur’ at Park Hyatt Paris Vendôme is a haven of cosy elegance tucked away a few steps from glamorous Place Vendôme. We were warmly welcomed by all the staff and placed at the VIP table overlooking the kitchen. If I had to pick up a single word to sum up this experience of a lifetime it would be PERFECT. For that’s exactly how it was, from the attentive yet friendly service to the succession of exquisitely prepared and savory dishes: stuffed morels with Iranian lemon, ‘shiabu’ style foie gras and tiny langoustine ravioli to start with, followed by an extraordinary barbecued blue lobster tail with jalapeños, dried apricots and crispy asparagus. As for dessert, the chef had especially made a mango and citrus birthday cake very elegantly decorated with gold leaf and a golden chocolate tag wishing my younger son Adam a Happy Birthday!"
83,"My husband & I booked here to celebrate running the Paris Marathon. From the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic, they were so attentive and couldn’t do enough to ensure we had an unforgettable experience! We decided to really treat ourselves and had the 8 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. The food was out of this world amazing!! To compare this to other one Michelin starred restaurants is as I feel Pur’ should have two stars ⭐️ ⭐️ Thank you again for a wonderful experience we will not be forgetting it any time soon!!"
84,We reserved a table for my daughter’s birthday( the evening before) . Everything was well organized in advance - confirming requirements and restrictions and special requirements to make the evening special.  The service was outstanding and the food was truly memorable. We had the 6 course menu - each course was masterful.  My only regret? That we had to hasten towards the end and miss the last dessert so we could get home before midnight to uncork champagne for the birthday girl. We’ll head back sometime in the next months to make sure we make up for that !
85,"I am comparing this to other 1 Michelin star restaurant but this is difficult as I feel that this should have two stars, so if I’m being picky I’m really comparing this to 2 or 3 star places.  Arrived at the restaurant and excellent front of house staff led us to table, handing off smoothly on the way.  We ordered cocktails, an Amigo fashioned which was sweet and delicious and a Roasted Toni which was nice but the bar is far away so we had the amuse Bouche and bread before the drinks arrived. In a perfect world these would have been held back until the drinks arrived.  The Amuse Bouche were outstanding. Chef had made alterations for my mint and seafood allergy, but the Mexican tortilla with guacamole and the hint of heat should be a staple.  The Pre starter was superb and the asparagus and foam was a good improvisation.  We ordered the ‘As Time goes by’ menu with a single wine flight to share. The menu consisted of duck foie gras, monkfish, bresse chicken, cheese cream, pineapple dessert, chocolate dessert, coffee.  Wine for first course went well and married with the raspberry and cut the pate feel out of the mouth. Crispy fried onion in the foie Gras and the raspberry were unexpected but a great flavour combination giving you a sweet and tart hit. The noodle had no taste, just adding a nice texture as the foie gras was quite creamy.  Second wine no bouquet and flat. Unfortunately Chef had provided an asparagus Pre starter for me and I had more asparagus for second course while my partner had the monkfish, which was superb. The asparagus was nice but having just eaten asparagus it was not great to have more. However Chef realised his mistake and we had a bonus course of Waygu beef as an apology, which was a very generous offer.  A simple spoon of granita as a palate cleanser was a lovely touch.  Then Bresse chicken. We had looked forward to this but unfortunately the smell of Waygu beef was in the restaurant (while smelling amazing, this meant the chicken could not be smelt properly). However the taste of the chicken and how it had been treated and dressed with morels was exquisite. Full of flavour, a wonderful mouth feel of rich tender flesh complemented by the carefully stuffed skin. A triumph of cooking and worth coming for by itself.  We then tried the Waygu, it was delightful and handled well but still the Bresse chicken for me was the better main.  The Brie cheese cream was next and chef had managed to pack it full of flavour while keeping a light silkiness that filled the mouth with a tingle and an earthy fullness of flavour.  Two desserts followed. The first was a pineapple and coffee for my partner which she devoured in moments. I had a Granny Smith and beer desert that was tart and rich and quite simply a masterpiece from the pastry chef. They should really make this their signature dish.  We finished with the chocolate smash that contained olive oil and an olive oil ice cream. Added to the menu yesterday this was a sweet and salty finish that was a delightful pairing with the wine (almost like a olorosso sherry)  A brioche with chantilly cream rounded off a 3 hour supper that was exquisite overall.  Staff are on the ball and friendly and they seem to know the menu very well providing excellent overview of the food presented and superb service, managed adroitly by Camille (the manager). Service is almost impeccable, just below Le Gavroche, which to me is the gold standard and better than Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester and any other place I have eaten. You really need to see how much more you enjoy food when it’s served and you’re looked after to this standard. It makes the meal!  Overall I would recommend that Michelin take a strong hard look at their award of a single star for this endeavour as it seems to be less than it deserves. Staff and Chef are worthy of at least one more star if they fix the venting for the grill so the smell of steak doesn’t permeate the restaurant when it’s dropped to the grill and quite possibly 3 if they fix the challenges I felt they had on the wine flight (excluding starter, bresse and chocolate desserts, which were very good matches). I’d rate this in the top 2 of the 25 Michelin restaurants we’ve been to in the last 2 and a bit years.  Next time in Paris, it’s the first on my list to visit."
86,"Excellent food and attentive service at this Michelin starred restaurant walking distance from the Opera Metro stop. In the Hyatt hotel. Very creative and delicious food. Romantic ambience. A bit expensive, but worth it for a unique dining experience."
87,"The above says it all. The food is amazing, small portions, but with a multitude of flavors. Hitting the palate from every angle the dinner unfolded with impeccable service and a lovely ambiance. I cannot say enough about this wonderful experience"
88,"Wow, words can't describe how wonderful this was and how much fun my partner and i had. My partner surprised me with this dinner, and it was superb. My partner and i aren't complete foodies we enjoy our food but aren't Michelin star hunters and i think the staff appreciated that we were asking questions, listening to how they choice the wine etc and the i think the staff really appreciated this as we were totally involved. I cannot fault this place, thank you for making my 26th birthday incredible!"
89,"The reservation process through tripadvisor was very easy and the confirmation was received within minutes. I wish I could give 10 stars to the service as it was truly exceptional, everything was really perfect. We ordered from the menu and the dishes were beautifully presented and the portions were adequate. However, I must point out that the flavors of the food were not as exceptional as I was expecting. The foie gras was truly exceptional with a flavor and texture I have never tried before but the rest of the plates were very good. The sommelier was also amazing and she gave very good pairing suggestions. The cheese table was amazing with great recommendations from Ms Camille."
90,"An amazing experience for me and my wife, it was all delicious, highlights for me were the chicken, scallops and pineapple with coffee desert. It was made special with exceptional service."
91,"We dined at many wonderful restaurants in Paris, many of which were more budget friendly yet still excellent. Pur was the best dining experience of our trip and quite possibly our lives. We did the 6 course menu. We started with champagne and were served complimentary appetizers. The attention to detail was spectacular. The staff was young, excited, and attentive. We have dined at multiple Michelin restaurants. I could not recommend this place more. Superb."
92,"Excellent service, prompt and attentive. Nice ambience and decor. Very refined food with exciting flavour combinations. Particularly noteworthy were the scallops with a Mexican twist and the chocolate and cherry dessert. Super!"
93,"My wife wanted to celebrate her birthday here because of the romantic setting. Had to book ahead quite a bit, the process was great, as I asked for a birthday cake for my wife, I got a very fast response from the team there, we worked through what I wanted, and 48 hours before the dinner I was asked to confirm again. The dinner was amazing, we had the ‘as time goes by’ menu, I loved everything, amazing taste experience. Service was outstanding, and the cake at the end both beautiful and delicious. My wife loved every minute, thank you to the team at pur!"
94,"We visited Pur for dinner on a January Saturday evening. Every dish offered in the six course tasting menu from amuse bouche to second dessert was perfection on a plate. The wine pairings were really carefully matched and every one of them worked. The service was at our pace, friendly and attentive. We cannot recall enjoying a dinner as much as this - ever."
95,"We've booked the restaurant a half year in advance and I must say that our expectations were really high. Generally, it was a pleasent evening but I do not really think that all my expectations were completely fulfilled.  Now, some details. After a pleasent welcome and brief hello from chef, we took a glass of champagne and our 6-course menu started. As we are a big wine lovers, we took a menu with wine pairing. The first meal was a crab meat in a small ravioli. With a second bite, I hit a part of crab shell which is really very unpleasent. After couple of seconds, my wife had a same problem (so this was not a unique case). Very honestly, I would not expect such mistake in restaurant on this level. We received a Maconnais white Burgundy to this course and a wine was a disapointment. So, our start was not very good. With a second course, we received pan fried scallops and those were really awesome. Accompanied with white Bordeaux, this was really excellent and returned mood at table back where it should be. Third course was a decent stuffed chicken (still nothing really special), served with a glass of Le Clementin du Chateau Pape Clement 2012. Although from a poor vintage, this was far the best wine we had the evening. After a cheese, we received two deserts and both were great. I am not so much about sweet stuff but especialy citrus fruit desert was probably one of best desert I've ever tasted.  So, while overall, this was a nice evening, it must be said that we paid 535 € for two persons. I had a comparable menu in couple restaurants where price was around 300 €. Yes, we are in a heart of Paris so +100 € but that is still around 400 € and I just have a hard time to justify that remaining hounderd. Probably the biggest weakness was a service. Too many trivial mistakes like serving food from wrong side or quite a lack of comunication with guest.  Long story short, this was a nice evening, no questions about that. But it was just nice, not great, not perfect. And for the price we paid, I am just not sure."
96,"My family and I enjoyed a wonderful night at Pur'. We were greeted nicely by the Hotel front doorman and escorted to the restaurant, seated with a great table and had a wonderful first impression. We were with my two young kids. The staff was excellent toward the kids, treating them nicely and offering them pillows on the bench, juice, etc. They had a very very nice kids menu. I love seeing these type of restaurants with options for kids, which keeps them happy and allows the adults to have a good night too. We had the Christmas Dinner menu with wine pairing. Excellent dishes. Only item of notice was the chicken main course. it was very good, but thought maybe chicken was a bit too easy for this type of restaurant. At the end of the day. Well priced and excellent quality. Had a great time. Highly recommend!"
97,"Pur is an amazing restaurant! The food tastes delicious and the creativity of the courses is incredible. the staff is kind, attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is great. The only thing that wasn’t perfect was the coffee (unfortunately from an automatic coffee machine) but it’s just a little thing. The restaurant still deserves 10/10!"
98,"When they say hospitality and quality PUR is at its excellence! CHEF ROUQUETTE can deliver marvelous menus! ....choose the pre fix with 8 courses! and wine paired with!! the 12 course is also available! Divine is the word! ....PUR is an inmaculate place for international dinners, gourmets,,,,,or Winos! Because they feature wines from all over the mayor wine regions! And the speak with foundation and knowledge in every course! In every ingredient ,,,,,in every little detailed recipe ....your waitress will be ready explaining every tone of the flavors in each dish!! !! a trip of our lives! to seal 3 months of travels.....PUR is much more that FRENCH hospitality is a place for worldwide food and wine connoisseurs! STOP by but call first and ask for the CHEF table inside the kitchen......a very talented team of cooks under Chef Jean Francois Rouquette!! We celebrated 12 years of marriage! A treat ! that we all need once in a while ! Divine Dinner!! Make reservations only open up 7.45 to 9.30 pm !"
99,"Exclusiv and delicious food in a nice environment. Excellent waiters, extraordinary tastes. Expansive but worth! You have a nice bar to complete your evening!"
100,Lovely romantic Christmas dinner . The food and service lived up to its reputation. The extras in my picture were a lovely addition to our meal !! Thank you for a wonderful experience!
101,"service - perfect wine - perfect chef - more than perfect , he is so creative :-) you can taste earthy sour and salt at the same time in one bite .We took 8 course tasting menu and have an Alice in wonderland trip in our mouth .Also he is spoiled you with some starters and amuse bouches that are not in your menu.But I have to say that some of the items in tasting menu are very exquisite such as Abolones and veal . smoke- not inside but there is lovely garden very near the restaurant you can have break here. Atmosphere - restaurant is in the Hyatt Vendome Hotel very elegant very Parisien and chic. We went here at our 25 th wedding anniversary and had a lovely night.  Thanks to all stuff :-)) we had a wonderful night ."
102,"We had dinner here on a Saturday night and opted for the Passing Time 6 course menu. Service was lovely, wine list was extensive, food was wonderful. We were seated at a table in the rotunda, which was very elegant. Everything was perfect except we waited a long time to get our check. Probably not a long time by Parisian standards, but definitely by American standards. They seemed to be having trouble with their credit card processing machine and apologized about it. Aside from that, this was a lovely meal and I think they deserve their Michelin star."
103,What a wonderful dining experience. Food is presented to table looking amazing and tasting FAB !! A great fine dining experience in Paris.
104,"The atmosphère, The Food (of course ...) , the set-up , the Decoration, The Chef (who came to finish some cooking/cuting at our Table) ... The Team (Camille and Team Mates) ... What can we expect more ? Would not be surprised to see another star next to this place ... we will come back and that's the best compliment we can make. / very complete Experience and so many things we would like to taste on the Menu -  Thumbs-Up"
105,A bit Hayden at the bigging and it will worry you undid to call to find . Then hay expecteshon was to the best of the treet hayle recommend grait food trait Seres Thankyou
106,"Unique restaurant and beautifully combined with our holiday at Hyatt Paris Vendome. The meal and all the wine pairings were amazing!! Fantastic dinner!!! The service also deserves congratulations. In general, I have noticed an attention to detail,which I really loved in this restaurant.  We'll be back again soon!!"
107,"We ate dinner here for our 7th wedding anniversary, and our experience was amazing from start to finish. Everyone on the staff was wonderful and delivered exceptional service. Every course of the tasting menu was delicious -- the dessert courses were particularly divine. And the sommelier selected excellent wines to pair with our meal.  Pur' is more than deserving of its 1-star Michelin rating, and we look forward to returning again next time we're in Paris. Thank you for such a wonderful evening!"
108,6 course taster plus wine pairing simply stunning. Sublime flavours with the pomp and ceremony to accompany such flair. I asked for a french description of each meal with an English translation for my wife Impecable from all staff. Even the striking union protestors lapping the restaurant with flags high vis vests and placards added to the experience Felt thoroughly spoiled
109,"Wife and I along with another couple were at Pur in October. The staff was absolutely wonderful! could not have been better. Cyrille even recommended other restaurants for us in Florence, Italy, where we were headed next."
110,The restaurant were notified of my allergy issues a couple of weeks in advance to establish whether the chef was prepared to adjust set menu to allow for my problems. I had a fantastic meal eating things I would never have risked before worrying if there was a ingredient included I had problems with eating.
111,"Typically i wouldn't let the service at a restaurant ruin perfectly good dining on a lovely summer evening out with my husband. However Pur' did just that. I find the Parisian service culture second to none and thus was appalled over the condescending, blatenly rude mannerisms, on several occasions, by our garcon. It got to the point where i just stopped responding to him and let my husband talk for me. By the end of the meal he was fine but it was too late-- he overshadowed the food."
112,"We went to PUR as part of our week celebrating our honeymoon. By far, PUR was THE BEST meal and may be one of the best meals we’ve ever experienced. The staff was incredible - attentive but not intrusive. Camille was the best server ever - helpful and informed and so kind. And the food...simply stellar. The room is spectacular - we had the tasting menu which was amazing. We loved it!"
113,"Restaurant Pur' is a Michelin star rated restaurant located in the Park Hyatt Hotel near the Palais Royal. My wife and I had dinner there to celebrate a 40th anniversary. The food and wine pairings were excellent. Unless you are an expert on French wines, I strongly suggest letting them pick the wines. They are very good. The wait staff was attentive and helpful and spoke English. This is a fairly expensive dinner experience, but worth it."
114,"We had a wonderful dinner at Pur, the best of our trip to Paris! We had booked a table online several weeks before and were promptly contacted by the restaurant since a credit card deposit was required. Despite this, we were again contacted a few days before the reservation with a request to confirm again. This was to celebrate a birthday and we were also asked to confirm whether a cake would be required and what type. So very good customer service even before we arrived. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful, (located in Vendome), and we were seated immediately. This is a fine dining, not a casual restaurant and the atmosphere was perfect for the occasion. Not loud, but not one of those restaurants where you are afraid to have a good time. Unbelievable amount of staff and so we were well attended to, and everyone was really friendly and efficient. We did the tasting menu with wine pairing which was not overwhelming as some of these experiences can be. Compared to the cost of some other restaurants in Paris, the price was not bad especially in such beautiful surroundings and with such attentive staff. The food was delicious. Good sommelier who was a young French American . He took his time to explain the wines and also chatted with us a bit. This was one of my best dining experiences anywhere and I am so happy we picked it for our special celebration. It was perfect!"
115,"Excellent service excellent food worth every penny , the wavy beef was amazing , could not fault anything about this experience, will definitely be visiting again when in Paris"
116,"A wonderful meal at a beautiful restaurant. We started with glasses of premium vintage Champagne. Normally the restaurant only serves a ‘prix fixe menu’ to the whole table, but our hostess permitted us to vary that at our table of four. She also substituted a couple of dishes for my wife who doesn’t eat shellfish (even the chicken dish had a broth of razor clams), and served her wagyu beef that she thinks is the best she’s ever had. The parade of courses (my friend and I had the 8-course menu) was flawless. Each delicious. We selected the wine option and were not disappointed by the selections. Definitely the way to go and worth it. At the end, our hostess, Camille, comped us on the Champagne we drank as an aperitif!! Lovely, friendly people who accommodated our every desire."
117,"This was a our first time in a Michelin star restaurant and this place is just amazing, everybody from the restaurant just made us feel like king and queen of the world. The attention, service, the conversation were just wonderful. We had the 6 courses dinner paired with wines and every plate was a perfectly match with the wine and the courses were brought in such an order that it set perfectly for our taste. This dinner made a big deal in our vacation to Paris. Merci beaucoup!"
118,"This place is amazing, the food here is really very good and to die for, the service is very good and the staff is amazing."
119,"Pleasantly surprised to get a booking same day - especially on a Sunday when many Paris restaurants are closed. We must have got the last table as it was full. Lovely and innovative cocktails in the bar to start and then decided on the full monty tasting menu. First restaurant I've been to in a long while that has menus ""for the lady"" without prices on them!  Service was almost flawless throughout, but there were a couple of minor things like them forgetting the beer I ordered - they did remember eventually but by then it was too late. Lots of staff an all worked well together. Everything was delicious and well presented and by the end we were well an truly stuffed - despite being really hungry having been in Paris for a 16KM race, so we were definitely hungry when we got there.  Not cheap, but I'd say worth it."
120,Everything was really good in here ! We ordered the “ trip diary “ which was an 8 course menu . The foie gras shabu style was probably my favourite the foie gras was melt in your mouth and love the noodles with it . We had the fig dessert which wasn’t really our thing as we don’t really like fig and they apologise by offering us a glass of champagne but of course not their fault as we just don’t like fig ! Will definitely come back the food was spectacular and the waitresses and everyone serving us was wondering !
121,"We visited Pur for our wedding anniversary. There's nothing not to like in this place, excellent ambience, well trained staff with state of the art service and really nice food. Given the plethora of awarded restaurants in Paris, Pur is a great place combining quality, ambience and a unique experience."
122,"We decided to make a reservation because it was a two Michelin star restaurant at the Park Hyatt where we were staying and we were too tired to go out. I should mention that we took our 8 1/2 year old with us. The highlight was that the staff who was very attentive, accommodating, and personable. They met all our needs with a smile and made sure we enjoyed the experience. Now the food. They started by offering a choice of champagne: Pierre Trichet cuvee 1333. Incredible. It's not available in the US, which is very disappointing. The wine list is extensive and very good. We shared two appetizers which were very good and the main courses were phenomenal. You will not have much room for dessert but you should do your best to have some because it is good! Overall, a great experience and quite reasonably priced."
123,The food is so good the service was second to non and my feelings are warm all over. One thing take a big credit card with you. Wine prices are out of control and I told them so. This was why only 4 stars.
124,Pur was a magical night for my wife and I from the moment we arrived. The staff are friendly and attentive. My wife and I had the Trip Diary with wine. The food was incredible and the wine pairing an excellent match. The pricing is exceptional and more reasonable then other michlin rated restaurants We will definitely revist Pur the next time we are in Paris. Thank you Pur for making our visits memorable one.
125,"It’s very nice dinner, the ambience, the staff, the service are good. I took 8 courses and it’s really good, the quality and the presentation are excellent."
126,"We did the 6 course meal offered and it was outstanding!! Free appetizers and each course had magnificent flavors and were very unique with signature French sauces. We even got 2 extra desserts! Very good. Only caution, be prepared to pay $500 euros for dinner with wine."
127,"This can be very hard to get in to, but since we were staying the street, we dropped in and asked to be placed on the waiting list. Lo and behold, we did get in ;-)  We opted for the 8 course meal, which is expensive, and the wine pairing adds on, but this is a case where the food, the service and the pure art of the presentation are actually worth it!  This meal will take just over 3 hours to complete, so plan accordingly, or opt for the 6 course version.  What is very nice is that you can have input on the courses, or opt for the chef's choice.  For us, this was an amazing, once in a lifetime experience. A foodie's dream come true!"
128,"We had a delightful dinner at Pur to celebrate the last night of a fun-filled sisters trip to Paris. The 6 course tasting menu was beautifully presented, the service was attentive and gracious, and the food was delicious! Pacing of the meal was great, and the gratis appetizer, amuse Boucher and pre-dessert made the 6 course dinner a 9 course one! We were comfortably seated in a banquette which promoted a more intimate, private dining experience which allowed us to be silly, laugh, and fully enjoy ourselves. Many thanks to Cyrille Combin, Pur Supervisor, and his team for a lovely, memorable meal, and we look forward to our next visit!"
129,Just amazing. We had the tasting menu. Enjoyed every part of the 8 different parts of it. Go for the tasting menu. Worth it.
130,"We had the 8 course menu with wine accompaniment. The food was excellent. You need to book and reconfirm your booking - which makes sense to avoid empty tables when the restaurant is popular. I replied to an email confirming my reservation, but the following day received a call (after a missed call a couple of hours earlier) advising me that my reservation had been cancelled as I had not reconfirmed. Fortunately, upon indicated that I had confirmed by email my reservation was honoured - but not the sort of mix up you expect from a professorial establishment. The meal was very good, but not outstanding. The wait staff all very pleasant and attentive, but away from the table there was a sense that they were rushing around all the time, which was not entirely necessary. Chose the wine accompaniment as I appreciate having wine paired for particular food. However, for one glass I had a load of sediment in the bottom - this is not what I expect when served by a sommelier. In my wife’s desert she had a piece of baking paper - also not what expect in this type of restaurant. It was an enjoyable meal but with a few minor issues and room for improvement."
131,"This was an experience from the moment you walked to the Maitre'd station to when you are seated. Welcomed by friendly, attentive staff that make it seem like a dance. The menu is a culinary experience I will never forget. We pared the courses with the chefs suggested wines. Great way to go. I'm not a big white wine fan, but the pairings were dead on and I never regretted following this chef's choices. Food has to be experienced."
132,We recently had the pleasure of dining at Pur' for our last dinner in Paris before we traveled to Lyon. We chose the six course tasting menu with wine pairings and thoroughly enjoyed every course. The service was excellent and the staff was very accommodative of our lack of expertise in French. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wishes to experience a truly exquisite dining experience.
133,"This is a really exceptional restaurant. The staff are the perfect mix of friendly and formal and were obviously both keen to please and proud of what was being produced. The young female sommelier was particularly knowledgeable and charming: we had the full 8 course tasting menu (Trip Diary) with the accompanying wine and she wrote out a list of the wines for us. The food was exquisite: inventive and interesting without crossing the border into unnecessarily ""adventurous"". Highlights were a delicious asparagus panna cotta with tarragon that was simply essence of asparagus, a foie gras ""like a shabu shabu"" cooked in rhubarb broth and a superb piece of turbot with herbs, wild garlic, paradise seeds and blood orange. The cheese board was a very good one: it avoided the mistake of too many cheeses, and all were served in a perfect condition. The accompanying wines were all well matched, particularly a 2016 Condrieu with abalone and artichoke. We hope to return soon. In fact, i think with various additions, it was in fact about 11 courses but it was well judged in terms of content and portion size."
134,To eat exquisite French food. I had the smallest (5 course ) tasting menu which of course expanded with several amuse and several desserts. Each dish was beautifully prepared and presented and the wine pairings were spot on. I was even served a cider which was one of my favorite pairings. The service was the perfect blend of formal and friendly. The meal was about $275 and worth every cent. The room is comfortable and even with a large party felt private and suitable quiet.
135,"We’ve been to quite a few Michelin restaurants in Paris now and this has been my favorite. Every detail was perfection. We ordered the 6 course tasting menu - it ended up being 9 courses with the extras they threw in. The beef, chocolate desserts, brioche, and cheeses were standout amazing but the entire experience was top notch. They change the menu out seasonally so we will absolutely be back. Highly recommend."
136,We did not regret having my birthday dinner here. The service was seamless and the atmosphere is elegant. We also liked the menu which had a nice selection of fish and meat. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience.
137,My wife and I read the reviewsabout this restaurant on TripAdvisor We are fully amazed by service. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves fine dinning and is visiting Paris.
138,"I flew to Paris for the singular reason of eating top class cuisine. I did my homework and was very selective as to who offered the best. It was not easy but PUR was a standout for its stunning and perfect tasting menu. Rated as a Michelin 1* I feel it should be 2*, I felt it was better than some 3* and a far better value. The tasting menu had greater variety than any I had seen,,, Abalone in seaweed with a Chardonnay sauce, Perfect chicken with morels, Pyrenees Spring Lamb ,Roast Tubot, and Caviar with a panacotta, Duck Foi Gras .... during a delightful 2.5 hours. enjoyable 3 course desert so counting the 3 amuse+ the 3 deserts+ the 6 main courses add wine and it comes to a very reasonable 160 Euros. without wine. Which is pretty cheap when many menu's are in the 370-470 range..  Based on what you get for your Euro/dollar,PUR is fantastic. . The kitchen is an open style and you can observe the brigade at work. Excellent technical mastery and presentation of texture, color and taste.... Hey Abalone, In France.... Nobody has done this anywhere but PUR... The Chef has passion and creativity. This is not tourist grand cuisine this is the future .  The ambiance and style is semi modern and elegant. I dined by my self and the staff treated me with extreme warmth and friendly/not aloof...even funny. . If you are serious about quality cuisine and serious dining then Pur is the bargain of Paris... I say this after some 5 trips to France to dine over 30 years. If your looking for a original menu and great service.....head to PUR by the Opera. in the 8th I considered it to be in the top 15 restaurants in all of Paris and I have been to a few from Jamin and Tour de Argent in the past to L'Astrance."
139,"My husband and I decided to kick off our 30th wedding anniversary celebrations by going to Paris and having dinner at Pur. It was an excellent choice indeed! Right from the start it was a smooth and hassle free experience - I booked by email; always prompt and very polite replies, no hitches, extremely satisfactory communications. On the day, we walked from our hotel on Place des Pyramides, by the Louvre, to Pur, just off Place Vendome, a pleasant walk on a mild Spring evening - as you can see, the restaurant is situated in one of the loveliest areas in Paris. As soon as we stepped into the lobby we were taken care of and pampered from start to finish. Our coats were taken to a cloakroom. We were given a table in the centre of the colonnaded structure - it was perfect! Suffice to say I was offered a cushion for my back since I sat on the sofa, even getting to choose the size of the cushion! This was a great idea as I was comfortable throughout the meal and could then relax back onto the sofa for coffee, very thoughtful indeed. A small stool was provided promptly too, for placing bags and phones etc on it instead of cluttering the table. The service was excellent, can't praise the staff enough. They were attentive, obliging and efficient all evening, timing and pace of the meal just right and it was as if they were taking us on a wonderful culinary journey. Our servers explained everything about every course - what ingredients were being used, their provenance and how they were prepared, Same for the wines offered, which were all lovely wines too. The cuisine was divine, just what we were looking for, creative and innovative, far from the usual fare. Every morsel was bursting with flavour, a blend of ingredients brought together in perfect harmony, a work of art, both in taste and presentation. After every course we were left anticipating with pleasure the next one, to find out what delicious creation the chef was coming up with. Our servers made it perfect by explaining every step - the sommelier would inform you that the wine served would be for the one course or for the next two courses and so on. Mind you, there was no need to make the wine last if it was to be served with two courses, because top ups were offered - very nice touch. Also, for instance, the sommelier would say this is the first dessert wine for this evening, so you would automatically infer that there will be another dessert wine served with the second dessert. The ritual was perfect, plates removed, new cutlery, new glasses, then new wine and soon after the new course. Fresh bread was offered throughout, crumbs were removed from the table all the time. We had the Carnet de Voyage, an 8 course menu, with wine pairing. I cannot decide which course was the best - they were all fabulous! Besides the courses on the menu we were given a variety of amuse bouche, which did just that, tantalise the taste buds, making us anticipate what the main meal would be like, since they were excellent. I must mention especially, since it is a favourite of mine, the foie gras - heavenly preparation of this unique ingredient I look forward to when in Paris - it was by far the best I've had here, which is saying something seeing that I try to eat it every day when in Paris. We really enjoyed the cheese course, three very nice and different cheeses. Both desserts were lovely but the chocolate dessert out of this world good, perfectly balanced! Portions are of course of a manageable size to enable you to savour and enjoy each and every one of them. Last of all, and not part of the 8 course menu, with hands in gloves, our server brought us an exquisite treat - a conical shell shaped brioche, which he cut in four and served with the most delicious creme chantilly! The brioche was delightful even on its own! And a chocolate truffle with the coffee too. We really appreciated the service of all the members of staff and of course the culinary prowess of the chef and his team. As a final observation, I received an email from the Pur supervisor, thanking us for choosing Pur - it was a personalised email, even wising us a safe trip to our country, by name - a nice final touch too. We have been to some quite expensive Michelin restaurants in Paris - I have found my favourite this time! I have only two misgivings, that the dinner finally came to an end and that I don't live in Paris! However Pur has given us one more very good reason to return to Paris again and again."
140,"Every dishes like an art piece and taste very good. Sitting at the Chef table tonight is an unique experience, it overlooks the kitchen and we can interact with the chef while watching them preparing dishes and applying the finishing touches. Every staff is very nice and helpful! Every people in the kitchen are very focus on the food and you know that treat the food seriously and the kitchen is very clean. If you go, you should book the chef table!"
141,"My husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary by trying Pur. The restaurant is beautiful, the service is the perfect blend of formal but never stiff or snooty. We decided to go “all in” and have the 8 course with wine pairing. Each course is beautifully presented and well balanced, the wines complemented as well. In retrospect, I think the six course option would have been plenty. For us a three hour meal was just too much. I can’t really find fault, but for me, I am not sure I would do it again. I completely understand why it is an expensive meal, but I personally just did not find it compelling enough to go again."
142,"Crank up your foodie appetite and sit down for 6 or 8 delightful courses. Arrive hungry - there are several secret courses - a pre-desert, a second desert, a brioche, and cookies. The service is spot-on, and if you're lucky Jean-Francois will shake your hand on the way out."
143,"What a wonderful way to close out our Paris trip. An ""8 course"" dinner paired with some great wine. The service and the staff were just spectacular. It was such a great and delicious experience.....possibly one of the most romantic dinners we had."
144,"We had a very special anniversary meal here last month. The surroundings in the restaurant are beautiful, but were more than matched by the food, and the service we received. Both were utterly exceptional. We had the 6 course chef's menu with matching wines. The American sommellier was brilliant, and his choice of wines was great. The real star, as it should be, was the food. Every course, a faultless combination of flavour and textures, immaculately presented. Two glasses of d'Yquem finished a perfect evening!!"
145,"We had dinner at Pur on a cold Paris night. The place is superbly decorated and has a unique, futuristic design. The photos on the web site are accurate. Tables are nicely spaced and the general feeling is very warm and inviting.  Service was good and attentive.  The Lobster was good and nicely presented. The pricey (145 euro) beef wagyu was very tiny - just 3 very small pieces and was just too soft. Took 30 seconds to eat them and It felt like eating a cube of fat although it was not fatty. Just very very soft. Somehow it did not feel like meat and it had a bit of a bland flavor. Maybe that is the idea about the wagyu being so high end but the experience is underwhelming at best. About 25 grams - fitting in two tea spoons for 145 euros is not worth it.  Overall the food is good and presentation and service on par. They probably deserve their Michelin star but we were not overwhelmed."
146,"We had the 8 course tasting menu - absolutely sublime. The service was spot on, absolutely amazing. Fully recommend for dinner"
147,"OK, so this was special. We came to Paris for a week, to celebrate my beloved's 50th birthday. I did some research in advance, and decided that this will be the place.  First thanks go to Mariana, who communicated with me in advance of the visit. Professional, prompt to reply, working with us on the 6-course menu (we don't eat meat), adjusting it to our food preferences and the special touches for the celebration.  Then came the evening. Professional welcome, with elegance and grace. Once we got seated, we met James the sommelier. Unbelievably knowledgeable about wines and the profession at large. A delicious glass of champagne to start the evening, followed by an even more divine French red - to die for. On top of it, because we had fish, he recommended - and brought (on the house) - two glasses of white that fit the dish perfectly.  The service from the whole team was superb. SUPERB! Luc was equally professional and friendly, and we engaged in a few conversations about how they run the place, and the world of Michelin stars.  Then came dessert. Or, more specifically, first came the pre-dessert dish. It was followed by two separate dessert dishes, wrapping everything with a chocolate creation of one of the chefs who specializes in chocolate.  We have both ""been around"" and traveled various parts of the world, separate and together - and experienced a variety of restaurants. We unanimously agreed that this was THE BEST restaurant experience of our lives! Sure, it was also the most expensive one - and I would pay it again for this experience, without thinking twice.  Thank you Team Pur' for making this evening so unique for us!"
148,"Why this restaurant is not in the top 5, i would not know, i would even say it should at least be in the top 10 restaurants in Paris (currently sitting at #12 when Im writing this review)!  This was without a doubt my best meal I had and then to add to the experience was the outstanding service from all the staff!! I didn't get everyone's name, but Cyril was with us most of the night, so a special thank you to him.  The food was breathtaking, the flavours that came out of the kitchen was mind blowing and I cannot wait to return, i will most defiantly be back soon!  Thanks again to everyone at Pur!!"
149,"Excellent! We had a lovely time. The service is more than correct. However, a good music choice in the restaurant will gain them more sophistication. Thank you."
150,"8 course tasting menu. Yes, it’s a lot of food but can be battled through.  Caviar starter immense. Lamb main like a meat yoghurt it was cooked so well. Fruit baba towards the end very refreshing.  Accompanying wine flight perfect. Although the port at the end is a total sucker punch. Left very drunk.  Service top notch as is custom in these places.  Little gift bag containing cookies and brioche a nice touch.  Ate at a few Michelin places in euro capitals but this one stands out."
151,Wonderfully coursed dinner with excellent wine pairings. Intimate setting with no rush at all. We felt we were guided through an amazing dinner and was the perfect way to end our Paris trip. Food was top notch and staff was welcoming and attentive. Unforgettable experience.
152,"While staying at Park Hyatt Vendôme in Paris for a business trip and after three consecutive nights of high end dining out ( including L'Atelier de Robuchon ) I've decided to try the ""House Restaurant"" for a relaxing dinner. Well.... has been a very pleasant surprise. Everything has been just perfect: from the sitting right in front of the ""state of the art"" kitchen to the mouth watering 6 courses Set Menu. But if I do have to select only one reason to be back at Pur well.... they serve the best pigeon I ever had in my life. And believe me if I'm telling that I had a lot!"
153,"The atmosphere and layout of the restaurant is lovely, intimate and quite relaxed. Service was excellent from all staff. My first and main courses were great - first course was a delicious seafood veloute with an extremely generous garnish of white alba truffle, grilled wagyu beef main with tasty tapenades."
154,Had a wonderful dinner at Pur last night with the 6 course tasting menu for 100 Euros and the service like the rest of Park hyatt Vendome had been excellent.
155,"There are good restaurants with a rather pleasant setting. There are some excellent restaurants with a rather beautiful setting. And then, there's Pur ' - Jean-François Rouquette where each dish is an invitation to travel and happiness. Let's talk first about the very clean and classy setting of the restaurant. If you have to book, I invite you to request a table located in the middle of the central circle, as you can enjoy a beautiful view of the kitchen and a certain calm and silence. As for the dishes on offer, we chose to take the menu 'As Time Goes By...' (6 services).  The menu was more than enough food for each of us. Asides from those 6 services, we were also welcomed with some fine amuse-bouche which set the tone for the night. Our favorite dish was either the Scallops from Brittany, where I recommend to try and have a bite where you enjoy all the items from that plate together (the grilled avocado, the confited pepper and lime). Then the medallions of French Venison were cooked to perfection. You should definitely eat those rosy. And the desserts were fantastic, the Jeu de Pommes (Apples) were refreshing and tasteful, while the two-part chocolat dessert was the perfect ending to a great dinner, worthy of such a distinguished institution.  And the experience was also great all around. From the communications with the team before the dinner, to our departure from the restaurant, everything was above expectations.  And if you arrive a bit early, do not miss a chance to hit the bar and have one of their homemade, refreshing and creative cocktails.  I would definitely recommend for a date night, a family occasion or a business dinner, as it will be a memorable evening."
156,"Spectacular dining. My wife replicate the same plate 2 times. The staff, the atmosphere were incredible. The kitchen like a war machine: very well organized and very effective"
157,"We at as a couple in June.  I had hoped and expected it would be a very good experience, but it far exceeded my expectations. I have eaten in plenty of 2 and 3 Michelin starred restaurants including the Fat Duck, Le Manoir, The Dining Room at Whatley Manor but this was something extra special.  The Mushroom starter and Lamb main were beautiful and delicious.  The only slight negative was the sommelier trying to sell me £250 bottles of wine, when I was clearly not looking to spend that. Service overall was efficient.  It was a lovely evening and worth the £450 for 2.  Thank you"
158,"If you want an exceptional evening, food, staff, and atmosphere- this is your place. From the moment we entered, they asked would we prefer english, we had a night of food prepared to the highest level and every attention to detail.  We were celebrating a girlfriends 60th and it was worth every cent! The fireplaces in the lounge and the Christmas decorations only add to a perfect night. Don't miss it."
159,"Decided to go to Pur' after reading great reviews of the restaurant and I have to say it did not disappoint. Went for the ""Temps Qui Passe"" six course tasting menu with wime pairing which was really on point, especially the Dublin Bay Prawns and the Venison. From beginning to end the service was truly amazing and I would find it hard to fault it in any way, from anticipating guest needs, the timing of each course and the friendliness of each waiter and waitress, of whom were well able to communicate to us both in english and french when we wanted to practise the language! I think the restauant really does set the standard for a one star michelin and should keep going the way it is and that everyone in the service and kitchen teams should be very proud of the consistently excellent work they're putting in!"
160,"Arrived at the hotel a bit early so went to the bar for a drink (10€ for water). When the restaurant opened at 8pm we went in and were given a table right by the open kitchen which to some may have been nice but it was slightly noisy. I asked to be moved which they did without hesitation. Had the tasting menu with wine pairing which was divine! Each course was fabulous. The restaurant itself was really nicely decorated and there was a really nice ambience.  A few constructive criticisms- there was no wine pairing with the dessert courses which was disappointing. The service, although very attentive when serving and clearing the courses, was lacking somewhat when we asked for something in particular. We had to ask three times for more bread, twice for water and twice to see the menu. Granted very small issues but I would expect a restaurant of this quality to be able to cope with the basics easily.  Great experience! Highly recommended, even at an eye watering 450€."
161,"Excellent service, great wine selection, each dish just gets better and better, no pretense, good place to people watch as well. solid one star michelin restaurant. Fellow diners were wondering why certain Parisian restaurants do not have a star, and after having visited Pur', the reason(s) are evident. So good."
162,"We decided to escape for the weekend in Paris. We arrived Friday night and got a 9.30pm table. Funny how 9.30pm feels more normal in Paris than London. Nice and very romantic atmosphere. Totally attentive service. They were monitoring when you run out of bread, water, anything and just replenish. The menu was out of this world. The initial wine we asked for was not available and they came back with another one that probably even better than the one we originally chose. I will email the restaurant to get the details, we were too absorbed in the food and with each other to even remember. I can't recommend it enough. At EUR 200 per head all in (menu is EUR 145 per head anyway) it is not cheap but there are times that you deserve much finer food than what you usually get in your daily life."
163,"We had an absolutely superb meal in this spacious yet cosy restaurant where the staff are professional, warm and helpful. We ordered à la carte and had 3 courses each; the restaurant also offers an appetiser, an amuse bouche and a pre-dessert, so you end up with six courses. None of these are too large so you leave feeling satisfied not bloated. There is a good wine list of regional varieties by the glass, and bread (3 types) is topped up as needed. All the courses were delicious, the flavours nicely balanced and the textures memorable; the produce is obviously highest quality and the dishes looked enticing on the plate. Having recently tried a few 1 star restaurants around France on this trip, this is definitely a step up. A fabulous experience!"
164,"My start to my dinner at this stunning French fine dining Restaurant located in the Park Hyatt Vendome was a drink in the open air bar with a opera singer singing live about 5 metres from my table. Her voice was as beautiful as the 9 courses of food I enjoyed an hour later in one of the world's great restaurants, Pur. The amuse bouche sums up the entire meal - it was served on 3 different plates, and included tiny bursts of flavour and texture which set a startling tone to the evening. Only Michelin star chefs with decades of experience can produce such delicate and intimate combinations of taste. The menu is wide and varied, but with such an extra ordinary chef, indulging in the designation and letting him take control as a must. We enjoyed langoustine carpaccio, Challan's duck with eggplant, harissa of piquillos and raspberries, The Cocoa dessert, all combined with astonishingly beautiful flavours."
165,"We were staying at the Park Hyatt for our wedding anniversary and had booked a table for a special dinner. We went for the Trip Diary menu with matched wines. Not cheap at €275 per person but definitely a special experience.  We had a drink in the bar first as the restaurant wasn't ready for us at 8PM. We got seated just before 8:30. I guess they were trying to avoid everyone sitting down for dinner at the same time.  The service was very professional albeit a little reserved but I guess that is what they are aiming for. The food generally was excellent and the wine pairings were in the main great.  Highlights for us were the fish course with razor clams and also the lobster. The meal was completed with a pastry served with cream flavoured with white pepper - delicious but very filling. The snail starter was OK but not something I would probably try again.  The only downside to our meal was the table of three women who spent the whole evening either taking selfies, playing music on their phones or talking loudly on their phones. Shame people like this are allowed!"
166,"My husband and I had dinner here while staying at the hotel, and had an absolutely wonderful experience. Be prepared to spend a few hours enjoying a perfectly paced and intimate coursed meal here. From the dining room to the flatware to the plating to the food, you absolutely feel that you are getting a Michelin meal at Pur. The service was absolutely perfect--particularly by European standards-and the gastronomy was exceptional. This was one of the few fine dining experiences where I didn't feel that pretentiousness clouded or eclipsed the actual quality of the meal. The dishes were complex, interesting, and unique. Highlights were the duck and the langoustine off the tasting menu. The wine list is also predictably excellent. JFR actually came out and spoke with each of the tables toward the end of the evening--unfortunately I was hardly able to get more than a few words out in my terrible French, but it's clear that he's deeply invested in guests' experiences at the restaurant. One thing to note is that this is a very expensive meal, so I would take that into consideration before bringing small children or a large family. Overall, an incredible experience that we'll remember."
167,"Overall the food and the quality of the ingredients is very good, well prepared and smart presentation. But food is also about taste which, in my view for a Michelin star restaurant, it to surprise us with flavors or textures that we would not expect. The dishes, namely the starter, did not achieve this goal. Overall, liked the experience but not loved it! It's a restaurant to visit in Paris but I would not give him a ""must visit when in Paris"", which was my expectation... In my humble opinion, probably a little less pretentious approach to the food, putting more flavor, would make the experience fabulous... The place is very beautiful and elegant... Dress smart for the occasion."
168,Michelin star experience here. Had the taster menu which was supposed to be 6 courses I think but in reality ended up being about 10 courses! Spent several hours really enjoying everything. Would definitely recommend. Worth the price.
169,"We stumbled upon this restaurant only because it was the only Michelin restaurant we could find that was open on a Sunday evening in the summer. What we found was one of the best restaurants of our 10 day eating tour of France.  It is rare to find a chef who can maintain consistency of quality and innovation across a tasting menu, but Pur' pulled it off. We were delighted by every course -- and felt there was nothing derivative or tired but the food. Moreover, the wine pairing was exceptional -- we were impressed by the pairings.  I will definitely return to Pur' in the next few years. I look forward to seeing the chef's evolution. For anyone serious about food, this place is worth a visit."
170,"I made my reservation online and indicated it was a celebration. They arranged a table right beside the kitchen, we were able to interact and watch the chef while they prepare the food. NOTE: it is a table with high chairs – so for those who doesn’t enjoy fine dining with high chair, you might want to emphasis that when you make your reservation.  In general, it was a great experience with good food but I would agree with most of other comments, it is a bit overpriced but due to the location and it is inside a hotel – I think it is still acceptable. Another feeling I have got, which was mentioned in other review, a bit rush as a fine dining experience. It was not a rush from the people, I think that feeling came from …. No time in between each course which I found it fairly uncommon in French / fine dining restaurant.  My advice is: if you are going for the food and careless of the location – then I might choose another restaurant."
171,"We managed to book a table for dinner on the day. It was one of the best meals I had. Service was flawless, environment was romantic, and the food was spectacular! You can see and taste all the details of each dishes and of course the presentation was beautiful! Another Michelin star restaurant chef was dining by himself next to us and he seemed to be really impressed as well. You will not regret visiting here!"
172,"This was a wonderfully relaxing and inviting dining experience after a long day of touring. The reputation of this restaurant led to our choosing to eat here and we were not disappointed in the least- it fully lived up to its high status. Located in a posh hotel, the atmosphere is modern and sophisticated and the cushioned seating was very comfortable.The food is outstanding- flavorful, beautifully presented, and ample. It is gratifying to know that just because you are in a fancy restaurant does not mean portions will be meager- you will not go hungry here. The staff were friendly and timed everything perfectly- again the mark of an excellent dining experience where your needs are met but you are not smothered or disturbed. It was a pleasure to relax and take time to enjoy the meal and feel neither delayed nor hurried. If you like tomatoes, you will love their three variety tomato entree, but, I can't see going wrong with anything on the menu. This was a real treat and it is worth every penny."
173,"Visited the restaurant after my graduation ceremony in Paris and this was the perfect way to finish off an amazing day. Not only are the staff incredibly friendly, but they are also so attentive, yet do not over crowd you! The food was exceptional (we have the 6 course taster menu) and I would 100% recommend to anyone! Having dinned also at le Jules Verne up the Eiffel Tower, I would say this restaurant has an equal wow factor, and the ambiance is superb. Hopefully be back again soon! \"
174,"This was the second time that I had dined at Pur. The first time, in 2013 was a great experience, but the second, in 2017 was the opposite. The cuisine was still good, but not worthy, in my opinion, of a Michelin star. For 180 Euros per person, my family and I expected much more. The service was excellent on both visits, but it didn't make up for the lackluster cuisine."
175,"This restaurant is truly special. Well appointed and minimalist dining room with plenty of room between tables, leaving the entire ambiance quiet and free of distractions. A partially open kitchen lets you see those busy at preparing your dishes, but with none of the ambient noise. Tasting menu was really well designed, and the centerpiece of each dish was the highlight, complemented nicely by the various components. The plates were were presented and demonstrated creativity and interesting flavor combinations. Everything was perfectly cooked, and the wines accompanying each dish were sensitively chose and explained. Service is extremely attentive and friendly, but not overly intrusive. They are always close by, but provide space to enjoy each dish. Of course it is quite expensive, but you leave satisfied and feeling like you have had a really nice experience. Without doubt one of the top restaurants in Paris."
176,"I can't deny that I had a good dinner, but I must say, it wasn't the best or one of the best in Paris.  The service was polite but not very friendly, the quality of the dishes was good but not the best.  Search elsewhere for a better experience"
177,"We, family of 4, had a great 25th anniversary dinner on June 27th. We had a ""Menu in 8 courses"" and were all absolutely pleased with everything. The wait staffs were pleasant and helpful, and the dishes were creative and superb. The kitchen, the staff, the menu, the wine list, the bakery are all the finest. I will recommend to everyone and will definitely come back again in the near future. Thank you for wonderful dinner."
178,"So it was the Saturday and my reservation was cancelled at another reputable fine dining establishment...  NO FEAR!  My hotelier found me a spot in this restaurant he used to work in and boy was it great!!!  As you'd expect the service was incredible and the flavours amazing.  After your fine dining experience, why not settle down in the court yard and enjoy one of their finest cigars.  Incredible experience."
179,"I visit Paris annually in summer and make sure to always enjoy one dinner at Jean-Francois Rouquette's restaurant pur. Soon after my arrival I contacted the concierge to make a booking for me. At that point in time unfortunately no table was available anymore and I was offered to join the waitlist or make a booking at another restaurant. Luckily, I joined the waitlist which within 24 hours confirmed the booking. My friends and I ended up dining at the chef's table, which can be separated from the restaurant by curtains and provides a more romantic dining experience. We chose Chef Rouquette's 8 course diary tasting menu and wine pairing which was an excellent choice."
180,My friend and I read the reviews before choosing this restaurant and we were very pleased to find out the positive reviews didn't fail to disappoint. The tasting menu portions were much bigger then I expected. We were very full by the end of this dinner...and we skipped the bread. We did the wine pairing along with the tasting menu and we were very happy with the knowledge the Sommelier offered. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves fine dinning and is visiting Paris.
181,"Paris is not lacking for great restaurants and since this was a vacation, there's always the fear that we might make the wrong choice. With choosing Pur' we definitely made the right choice. The restaurant itself is beautiful, but beyond that the service was very warm, welcoming and knowledgeable and the food itself was excellent. The presentations for the plates were really pretty and only outdone by how good the dished tasted."
182,My wife and I enjoyed an outstanding dinner at Pur. Our appetizers were perfectly prepared as was our main course. The many delicious small dishes also served during our meal added a special touch to our dining experience. The sommelier helped us choose a great burgundy that went perfectly with our meal. We especially appreciated the wonderful and attentive service provided by the restaurant staff.
183,"I had one of the best meals ever in Pur. I ordered the multi-course ""Carnet de voyage"" tasting menu with matching wines. It was outstanding! All dishes were delicious, beautifully presented and perfectly matched with excellent wines. The service was exceptional. Nina and Camille were very professional, kind and nice. I highly recommend this restaurant for a fine dinner in Paris."
184,Dinner with some friends which were visiting. They enjoyed it as much as we did! I had the fois gras and the lamb. Both were excellent. The place is elegant and cosy. Its a great Parisian address.
185,"Our selection of 'Pur' for our dinner on Easter Saturday, was solely based on the fact that it was the highest restaurant in the Trip Advisor listing that still had capacity to fit us in, but how glad we were that chance took us there. From start to finish the meal was a delight. We didn't select the tasting menu because neither of us are big eaters, and it seems a shame to leave food of this calibre. Instead we chose the recommendations of the day: asparagus three ways, foie gras chaud, and blue lobster. ( I gather from Wikipedia that these are extremely rare,one in two million, to my unsophisticated palate it didn't taste any different !)The asparagus was a delight, with a smooth velouté, a tangy carpaccio, and a tempura battered spear. The foie was meltingly beautiful, perfectly cooked and still warm, my only criticism is that the richness of foie really needs to be counterbalanced with something sharp, like rhubarb.And the lobster was just perfect,... and blue !! All the waiting staff were pleasant, efficient and unobtrusive, while the kitchen was a hive of activity. For a meal this exceptional you don't even look at the bill, which is probably just as well !"
186,"We opted for the 6 course tasting menu, it was amazing, ended up with 9 dishes in total. Each dish was cooked and presented to perfection. The service we received from start to finish was outstanding. It was an expensive evening but it was definitely worth every single penny, the restaurant exceeded all expectations. Would definitely recommend for a special evening."
187,"It's a travesty that Pur' has only one Michelin star. Having dined in many one, two and three star restaurants in France, Belgium, Germany and the UK the dinner we had was right up there with the best of them. We took the six course tasting menu on the advice of the maître D' who said that the eight course menu was a lot of food. It was good advice because six courses was perfect for us. Often when having a tasting menu there are one or two courses that are less enjoyable but here every one is something that I would order again.  Service was very good - friendly and not over formal.  The only very slight negative is that a glass of champagne was the thick end of 30 euro (though it was a better than normal champagne) and there are very few (if any) bottles of wine at less than 70 euro, and not a lot below 100. In any case we will return the next time we are in Paris."
188,"We opted for the 8 course Trip Diary menu, which also included amuse bouche and a small starter. To accompany the food we also had the wine pairings. The food and wine was fantastic with well-balanced tastes all the way through. Wine servings a bit on the small side, but a refilling of the Mersault helped us getting through :) First 3-4 dishes were served too fast, but we asked the waiters to slow down, and the remaining service was impeccable. In general, I like less formal restaurants, but also appreciate that this is 1 star Michelin in Paris trying to obtain the 2nd one, so formality is expected."
189,"Pur exceeded all our expectations. Impeccable service, lovely ambiance. We ordered the 8-course tasting menu with wine pairings, had champagne to start and just had an all-in-all wonderful time. Each dish was more delicious than the next. As we were celebrating my birthday, they brought me a candle with dessert and we truly could not have asked for more."
190,"Went to PUR with wife and friends for lunch. The food was great, the atmosphere excellent and service ""impeccable""! Deserts were so good, we had 2 rounds of them. Great place to chill and enjoy your meal."
191,"Worst experience I had in Paris. I booked Christmas Evening reservations online about 2 months prior. I flew in on Christmas Day from the US and was very excited about the upcoming dinner which was a surprise for my wife. Upon arrival, I was told that there were no reservations for myself and my wife, despite me showing them the confirmation email and number I had received. They responded that the online reservation system must have made an error. I was told there was no way they could seat me or otherwise help. Then, the staff basically threw us out so that they could attend to others who were also arriving for an 8p meal.  This was Christmas Night, in Paris. There were no other restaurants that could accommodate us on such late notice. We ended up not eating dinner at all.  We tried many other quality restaurants in Paris while there, including others with Michelin stars. There is a level of professionalism and service that is to be expected at such places, and Pur lacked those qualities entirely."
192,"To celebrate a career change I decided on going to PUR last Friday. I absolutely made the right choice. The staff were all so attentive and professional. Everyone was just so friendly. Now the food. I was in bliss. Each dish had its own unique flavour. After each dish I was left craving for more, and the chef more than satisfied it. The portions , the presentation, the taste. And oh, the complementary dishes in the middle of each course was just a delight. I wld definitely recommend the blue lobster and the chocolate tree for dessert. Thanks !!!"
193,"It's the morning after the night before and I'm still thinking about the amazing experience at Pur'! I'm not sure I can put down in word how excellent our visit was, but I would honestly say this was the highlight of a very touristy weekend in Paris.  From start to finish this was amazing - we both went for the 6 course taster menu which was easily 11/12 courses and I've not been so full in a restaurant of this quality before! I will say this is a comfortable level of fine dining - the menu and ingredients are not massively intricate yet the results are mind blowing.  The level of service was perfect. My wife for example could not entertain the idea of pigeon (which was beautiful!) which was substituted for beef (also spot on). At 145€ the food worked out with the various amuse-bouche etc at less than £10 per course. Wine/champagne did add a bit to the overall bill as expected in a hotel restaurant but to be honest I felt the evening was worth every penny.  The highlight would have to be the monkfish which was cooked to perfection. The chocolate experience near the end is a must for cocoa lovers! My only issue would be that with a glance at the bill at the end of the night I assumed 20% service had been added and it was only afterwards that I realised two levels of tax (for food and alcohol) had been applied, so actually left without tipping! If anyone at the restaurant reads this, apologies for not concentrating enough in French class!! I hope there is a next time when I can double tip!"
194,We had reservations for this restaurant for Christmas Eve 2016. The meal was a fixe prix which was excellent. We chose to have the meal with wine pairings. The whole experience was exceptional and exceeded our expectations. The service was also impeccable.
195,We dined at PUR for my fiancee's birthday. We had the 6 course tasting menu. Absolutely perfect from start to finish. Excellent service. There was hushed background music which accompanied the food and wine very well. *****
196,"We went here because of the good critics and we had a good diner but... For the price we paid per person including wine-pairing, we had aspected more attention from the staff. Like cleaning the table or changing the cutlery was not as we should aspect in a restaurant of this quality. The sommelier was losing interest as the evening progressed. To bad, because the food was very good."
197,The service at this restaurant was impeccable and the food was excellent. Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone in Paris looking for a great time.
198,The best restaurant I had to try in Paris and I went to a bunch of them! All top 100 rated on TripAdvisor but this one is truly superb! The deserts were excellent and every from the beginning till the end amazingly dished out and the staff is handling you with great care.
199,"We enjoyed the atmosphere, it was nice and quite. Exquisite food, impeccable service and very classy.The meal and the wine's selection was outstanding and the service and explanations on all courses were most enlightening. It was one of our highlights on our mini vacation to Paris."
200,"Given all the positive reviews, we chose this restaurant to celebrate a 50th birthday.  The decor and ambiance are nice and service is what you would expect at Michelin star restaurant : attentive and polite.  We chose the six course menu with a wine pairing. Food was good but not really exceptional. However, there were two things in particular that we both found unsatisfactory : when you choose a wine pairing for an additional 140 euros it is a bit annoying when wines are quite average and they just pour you a little drop. That's a rip off. In other words - avoid the wine pairing.  Another thing is that the menu is not very well balanced. At the end there is a whole row of desserts/sweets. We'd rather have a little bit more of the main course. You finish a meal with something sweet - not loads of it.  In total I think we spent 470 euros for two. Was it worth it? We don't think so."
201,"Party of four, we dined at the Pur' for my sisters birthday! It was a very good choice!  One of the best meals I ever had! The coordination between the open kitchen, servers and sommelier is like in a Broadway musical! And you're part of it! Perfect for an anniversary diner!  High quality food (deserves 2 stars) in a perfect setting! Feels very luxurious but in the same time very cosy! Staff knows when to be there for you and when to stay away!  Amazing!"
202,"During my stay in Paris, I wanted to have at least one fine dining experience. I chose Pur' since it was a Michelin starred restaurant and they were open on a Sunday. Many French restaurants are closed on Sundays, so I was happy to find a one that was open. You should make a reservation. If I remember correctly, I think I made mine about a month in advance. The restaurant is located in the Hyatt hotel.  The ambiance is very nice. Typical of many hotel restaurants. However, it had a more loungey, but classy, feel which I found relaxing and nice. I liked the lounge like seating as opposed to rows of tables and chairs.  Come dressed nice - you do not have to be too formal - no gowns. But dress as you would when you go to a special occasion at church or formal work function.  I had the 6 course pre-fixe with wine pairings which included:  - Monkfish, Fennel, and Sweet Potato dish - Duck Foie Gras with Green Beans, and Quinoa in a Yogurt/Horseradish Sauce - Beef with Potatoes - A few dessert dishes  The staff was very accommodating to my friends peanut allergy, so I am unsure if the selections are in line with what they actual offer on their menu. I let them know during the reservation period and when we got there, they were very attentive to ensure that they met our dietary needs. In general, the service was superb. I feel confident in saying that it was the best service I had in Paris. Very professional and polite staff.  The wine pairings were superb. Everything paired well nicely. I did not like the port with dessert. However, that is not held against the restaurant as port is considered a dessert drink. I personally just don't care for port. Especially not with dessert. Not sure where that rule was established. lol.  I was a huge fan of all the entrees. It is very difficult for me to pick a favorite. I guess I would have to say the Monkfish. However, the Duck Foie Gras and Beef were cooked perfectly. I loved the layers of flavors. They were hearty without being heavy. They were nicely presented as well. The entrees itself would give this restaurant a 5 stars.  I gave 3.5 tar because of the desserts. I did not care much for the desserts. In fact, I do not think I really remember any of them. They consisted a big portion of the meal (8 in total I think). I do think I had a dessert with brie - and I remember eating it. This says a lot because no one can get me to eat brie. I usually do not have the pallet for it (it's possible it wasn't brie). But generally, the desserts were not memorable.  As an American, and this being my first fine dining experience of this caliber, it was difficult for me to get used to the tiny food. I am big into nutrition, and technically, the food is perfect portion sizes. However, it didn't prevent me from wanting a juicy turkey burger afterwards. I did not leave full.  I stopped at the restaurant bar after dinner. They had some very unique cocktails. I ordered the ""Puki Puki"" simply because I liked the name. It was a very beautiful and tastey cocktail. Very tastey cocktail - more memorable than the dinner wine. I vote that all restaurants should offer cocktail pairings with pre-fixe dinner. That would be nice!  The 6-course pre-fixe will run you about 235 Euro - not bad considering some other fine dining resteraunts were almost double."
203,"Most of the food I tasted was good, but God, insanely overpriced! The service was weird and rushed as well. If you want to spend 400 bucks on one main course, shared starter and wine, go ahead, but not worth it!"
204,"After a dinner in Giverny at a 1 Michelin starred restaurant we dined at Pur' also a 1 starred restaurant. What a difference. The service was more polished and the servers knowledgeable about the offerings. Since it is located in the Hyatt we were staying we confirmed our reservation at check-in. We had the tasting menu and matched wines. The courses were without the complete listing of ingredients; mushrooms , duckling with eggplant, goat cheese, figs with white cheese sorbet, and a to die for desert. The wines matched with each dish were perfect. The plating were artistic without being over the top. Dinner lasted over 2.5 hours and it was a great experience."
205,My husband and I visited the restaurant for dinner and were super impressed by both the impeccable service and the excellent food. Every detail is taken care of from the moment you arrive and are offered a glass of champagne to the moment you leave and they gift you a small bag of cookies to take with you. The food is delicious and the chef came out to greet all the tables at the end of service which was a great touch. We loved it and no wonder it has a michelin star.
206,"Worth every Euro, great service and fantastic food in a very nice setting. Ideal for business dinners as well as romantic dinner for two."
207,"I have had dinner with colleagues in this charming restaurant. Foies gras and wagyiu beef: simply outstanding. Of course the price is little high, but i didn't pay!!!"
208,My husband and I are our wedding celebration dinner here and felt is was a great choice for the memories. We loved the ambience of the restaurant and the open kitchen concept. We chose the smaller tasting trip menu and were surprised at the amount of food we recieved. Every course was divine with the subtle layed flavors in them. The desserts were astounding. Would return to try other menu selection should we return to Paris. Highly recommended for a special evening or just to have really quality food.
209,"In September my wife and I dinned at the Pur'.We chose the 6-course menu.Every dish was special,of exquisite quality,imagination and presentation.Calm, relaxing ambience with low lighting and beautiful decoration.The numerous and polite staff attended us with care and promptness.However the way they served us (the continuous flow of dishes)gave us a negative feeling of hastiness and distance between the staff and us. Overall our dinner at the Pur' was worth it and I suggest visiting it."
210,"Whilst having a real air of pretentiousness, it is a really good restaurant. The tables have lots of space between and nothing is too much trouble for the attentive and friendly servers. The sommelier is really knowledgeable and try's to recommend interesting wine and does not try and recommend the most expensive. She is a real asset. It's is a fantastic experience and not as madly expensive as some top end Parisian restaurants. Highly recommended."
211,"I would just like to say what a fabulous evening we had here to celebrate my husbands 50th. Even before we arrived the staff were fabulous, making every effort to make sure his meal was memorable. We opted for the 8 course tasting menu, which is really about 12 once all the amuse bouches are counted in. Each course was stunning but the wild mushroom and bramble starter stands out for its simplicity of ingredients but amazing flavour. Apparently it was the chefs mothers recipe originally and the brambles had been foraged in the south of France by one of the kitchen team while on a recent holiday. Such commentary by the service team just added to our glorious experience. The serving staff were very helpful, attentive and at the same time unobtrusive. This was perfect as it never once felt like we were in a stuffy, overly regimented Michelin starred restaurant. I would highly recommend this restaurant and hopefully will return if ever in Paris again. We went all in and had the champagne to start the evening in style and the wine flight to compliment the food. The wine choices were perfect with the food. The bill was expensive but partly down to a v weak Pound, saying that we expected to pay what we did and never felt like we had been ripped off Indeed I would say for the quality of service and food we had it could easily have been more and we wold still have been content. Well done to the entire team x"
212,"My wife and I ate at Pur during our stay at the Park Hyatt Vendome. The service, atmosphere and food were easily worthy of its Michelin star. Our waiter and sommelier were very accommodating, and this ended up making our night. By splitting appetizers, entrees and wine, they created a virtual four course ""customized"" tasting menu with wine pairings for both of us. Overall, there's a lot of competition in the area. But, if you're staying at the hotel (already a high end experience), this is a worthwhile complement."
213,"We ate here on a recent trip to Paris and were most pleased. After a perfectly horrible meal at Jules Verne, we felt like we deserved this terrific treat. It is not inexpensive, but almost half of what we paid at the tourist ripoff Jules Verne. Staff was welcoming and warm, even to English speakers. We began with an excellent glass of Champagne from their cart of several choices. The foie gras was meltingly delicious and served with a quinoa crumb, nice change from the traditional accompaniment. The lobster was tender and fresh, and all was served with care and warmth. We will go again."
214,This restaurant is situated in Park Hyatt Vendome in Paris. Absolutely incredible food with excellent service and a true delight for anyone who appreciates gourmet food at its best! Every course was a picture on a plate and the flavours were amazing. I will definitely be back! Truly worth every penny!
215,"We visited two 3 Michelin star restaurants in Paris during our vacation and enjoyed the Chef's Table at Pur much more! Both food and experience wise. The first thing we noticed was how professional the staff at Pur was. As we got to the host we told her we have the Chef's Table and from that moment forward we were treated like royalty. There were about 5 waiters constantly at our disposal and we were escorted to our semi private section where we were seated at a large table connected to the kitchen, with curtains around us so we could still see some of the dining room yet still felt very private. We had an open space from the table directly to the kitchen and the rest was glass, the way the chef's in the kitchen orchestrated the dinner was beautiful. They were so organized, so professional, so detail oriented and so quiet it was like a perfectly in sync dance. It was so impressive to watch them do what they do best and to get to then enjoy their works of art was the best part. Every dish was amazing and my husband and I were both blown away. We didn't want the night to end but I will say we left VERY full and happy."
216,"Its hard to review this place. First - very attentive staff, if a little stiff - but, as its a top end place, no problems with that.  The food went from stunning to complete misses, not bad, but unbalanced...  Not my favorite M.S. place."
217,"We had a romantic 8 course dinner with beautiful wines. Staff was very nice and service minded, we were treated like royals.  All dishes was was amazing, and we actually ended up with around 11 courses. Everything was beautiful put together with great precision and texture.  I really recommend going all in and order the largest 8 course dinner."
218,"of course 1 star Michelin, excellent food, my preference goes to anything salty since I would rather bake and eat that fancy desserts. Beyond expectations is service, attentive, courteous, explaining ingredients and conception. The chef comes to salute his clients, and gave me tips on preparing an amuse gueule. Genial!"
219,"We celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary in Paris and decided to go to Pur as the highlight of the stay.  Reservation was done online and quickly confirmed, overall the service high class and very friendly. The style of the restaurant which is located at the Hyatt hotel close Place Vendome is modern and very stylish.  We were guided to our table and started with Champagne as aperitif while studying the menu which did not show prices in the Lady’s version – very nice. The selection in the menu was just great, we decided to go for the 6 courses with wine.  Starting with the amuse gueule over the single course to the dessert was like a surprising journey of tastes exploding in our mouth, everything of highest quality and very delicious. The wines served to the courses were great and perfectly fitted to support the test of the meals.  We eat quite often in Michelin star restaurants during our trips but never had such a great experience like in Pur – we will definitely go there next time we are in Paris."
220,"Dining at Pur' is worth every last euro (and that's quite a few euros!). We had the six-course menu, which turned out to be more around ten. Each and every dish cooked to perfection. Service was attentive, and politely friendly. The wine selection was perfect, but unnecessarily small (5-10 cl each, maybe?) Skip the champagne aperitif unless you're really keen on it."
221,"Attended for dinner on Thursday 25/8. I think they lost me on arrival at the restaurant when we were told we could not enter because we were 3 minutes early, the restaurant would not open until 8pm and as we were literally minutes early, were asked to wait in the hotel lobby. Really?? How utterly pretentious. Is this really how a Michelin starred restaurant would treat their patrons, obviously yes. I was gobsmacked.  Like most other reviewers who had not previously dined Michelin star, I was eagerly awaiting this evening with much anticipation. On finally being allowed in after the expiration of those 3 minutes, I must say I was extremely surprised at how low the lighting was, thinking instantly upon being seated ""you eat with your eyes"" so how on earth was I going to do this when it was that dark I could not even see what colour my food was. The service could be said to be faultless, but it could also be said it was so over the top it made you laugh at the antics, and I have to agree totally with another reviewer who likened it to a fully choreographed ballet. I conjured up thoughts of ants rushing hither and tither across a very large ants nest. Three wait staff to serve two diners at a table. Clearly what sets a Michelin star dining experience apart from all of those ordinary dinners out was totally lost on me.  Underwhelmed by the whole experience, which to be honest I felt very sad about because I so wanted to enjoy my night. I think the absolute icing on the cake, after the wait in the lobby and the low light level was the fact that the 6 course tasting menu that was served was NOT what was advertised on the restaurant's website. This was what was used by us to make the decison to book the table. When this was mentioned, someone of importance was so mooned and came to our table to explain to us that the menu had been changed ""yesterday"" and there was a lag in the website update. Fine dining at its best? Debatable. Amends were made by the provision of a dish we said was listed on the website but had not been offered, the crab and calamari cannelloni.  I am sure the chefs worked extremely hard preparing our food though in the main my impression was most of the dishes were overpowered by one or more ingredient in the dish or a sauce, to the point where I found some dishes were inedible because of it. I am not a fussy eater by any means, but can honestly say the dinner as a whole was a total waste of money. At least this dinner provided me with a Michelin star dining experience which many many people could not lay claim to having done. Suffice to say I won't be rushing to repeat this experience. I am certain all of the wait staff knew how we felt because no comment was made whatsoever on our departure. No ""thank you"", ""hope you enjoyed your dinner"" NO nothing. We paid our bill and got up and left, not one single person even bothered to say goodbye as we left.  Value for money? No Food? No Service? Too over the top for my liking  Sadly, I will not be repeating my Pur' experience."
222,"We were in Paris for our anniversary; no better time to try our first Michelin star restaurant and we were not disappointed. The service was attentive and proper but not stuffy. We had the eight course tasting menu. The lobster and turbot were my favourite. It was an evening of adventure for our taste buds, and a very full meal we could not quite finish however thoroughly enjoyed."
223,"Was there with partner and friends Service OK Wine list on the pricey side; cocktails ridiculously expensive A few small surprising things for a * restaurant, especially at this price point : amuse-bouches were disappointing, bread choice was pretty limited... We did not take the tasting menu so did not have the chance to sample that many dishes. Overall the feedback was positive but noone was really amazed So nothing really to complain about, but I think there are many better options at this price in Paris"
224,"What a wonderful evening at Pur' The Chef immediately introduced himself at our Chefs table, and was very attentive asking if we had any food allergies etc. Wine pairings with dinner were excellent and the amounts were perfect to go with the tastings. Very original and spectacular courses throughout the meal. Very fair pricing considering this is a top restaurant at the Michelin level. Impeccable service. Amazing deserts. Highly recommend the chefs table where you can see really true artistry at work. Simply the best me am I have ever had. Viva la France ... Viva la PUR' !!!!!"
