26,"This was my fourth visit to Scarlett Green and I'll deffo be increasing that number for sure! Food (most importantly) was delicious, our table had the meat platter and the vegan platter. I’ve had the chops, ribs, sausage before and it’s amazing. The vegan option, which we ordered because we are on vaganuary was so good that we couldn’t even be tempted by the delicious meat our mates were devouring. Dessert was so nice and amazingly presented. The PS Martini is a fab cocktail. Our servers were excellent and attentive, great hosts and made the experience that more enjoyable; Alex Binod and the team are great, 5+star! Thank you Scarlett Green :)"

30,"Simple and amazing, in all senses of the words. We arrived with no booking, but it was around lunch time on a Mon.  Greeted by Stefan, who was smiling and incredibly friendly, to be then shown to the table. The decor was rustic but Stefan couldn’t have done any more to accommodate my partner.  The food was lovely, we had the ‘fancy bacon roll’ (which was bacon, egg plus avocado and I added halloumi), which was delicious and very well presented.  Next time we are in the area we will certainly return. The advise we were given was that on Fri and Sat they have live music, which we would enjoy, so for those less inclined it might be worth marking and avoiding."

It was our friends birthday celebration and they made us feel very special. I am coeliac so a gluten free menu was essential and Alejsandra made a lot of provisions to ensure I had the same experience as everyone. Fantastic meal, will be returning!"
38,I had a brilliant brunch here with two friends. The food was outstanding and couldn’t fault the service. The bottomless brunch was also really good value - I can’t recommend enough. Fab location and atmosphere as well.

Thank You Stephane for all you did to make our breakfast at Scarlett Green exceptionally splendid. Delicious. I’ve been told London has lots of good food. Scarlett Green has great food and great service. I love this restaurant."

68,We have enjoyed the most delicious and healthy breakfasts during three days of our stay at a nearby hotel. The place is modern and arty. The customer service is welcoming and very professional. Daniël.
69,"After reading that this was previously rated as the #1 brunch spot in the world we were excited to visit. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for us to realise that whilst this may once have been a beautiful establishment, it's heyday has long since passed.  The decor is looking pretty shabby with chipped plaster and paint apparent in every direction (and not in a rustic chic way). The bar looks good though, and the overall colour scheme was appealing.  We each proceeded to peruse our menus before comparing what we were going to have. For a confusing couple of minutes we thought we were being a little dim when we couldn't reconcile the orders, before realising that one of the menus was completely out of date and contained dishes no longer being served.  Overall, the food was relatively good and brought over in a timely fashion. The waiters were attentive right up until our orders arrived but then were very difficult to catch.  There was only 1 toilet (the disabled toilet) in action as there was a private function on downstairs, but if I were in a wheelchair I wouldn't have been able to use it as a result of all of the chairs and detritus that was stored in there. Even with this removed, the mirror is certainly not in a position to be used by anyone not standing.  If you walked in off the street with no expectations, you would probably leave with a smile on your face after a satisfying plate of food in a gentle atmosphere. If you're hoping for something remotely special, then go somewhere else."
70,Excellent brunch with 5 friends on a busy Saturday afternoon! Both the food and service were excellent - and I will definitely be returning in the future!

72,"WOW! Bottomless brunch for days!! Firstly, I've been here for regular brunch too, so if you're just after good food, here's the place. Secondly, if you drink a lot, the bottomless here SLAPS and is the best value for money for a bottomless IVE EVER HAD. The food is of such a high quality and the service is so fast and out of this world - big shout out to Binod and Taylor in particular who made it so amazing. I was a bit nervous as I came for a special occasion, but couldn't have made a better choice. This place is the bees knees, don't bother with anywhere else if you want the best brunch & service THANK YOU"

90,Fabulous Bottomless Brunch at Scarlett Green with friends today. The food was amazing - definitely recommend the fancy bacon roll.. definitely not just a roll with bacon in! The chocolate pancakes were absolutely delicious! The service was the best I’ve witnessed at a bottomless brunch - they couldn’t do enough for us.

126,"My wife and I were visiting London from Texas in early November 2022. We came across this restaurant as it was close to our hotel. We arrived for a late breakfast and were greeted warmly by the host. He engaged in conversation and ensured that we were comfortable and felt welcome. Sometimes it is hard to rave about breakfast but I have to say that the food was fantastic. The ingredients were not only fresh but carefully blended together to provide an explosion of flavor in your mouth. Not only will we be back but we will ensure that our friends know that this is in our list of recommended ""must visit"" restaurants in London."
127,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon for brunch (at 13:00 so technically lunch?) and it was perfect. The food was delicious and filling, and beautifully presented. The place had a nice atmosphere, and although busy not too loud.  There's few places in London I'd eat at repeatedly as there is so much choice and so much to try, but this is an exception."

134,"Staying at nearby The Resident Hotel which has a reciprocal arrangement with the restaurant.  The restaurant has an Australian theme - with Aussie styled items on menu.  We were warmly greeted by Stephane, the manager, who when out of his way to ensure we enjoyed our breakfast. Once determining that we were tourists- provided us with some tips to enhance our stay.  Chose two options from extensive breakfast menu - which were elegantly presented and delicious.  Only negative, and for us a real negative was the disappointing coffee. High expectations of trying a double shot flat white which is an Australian standard, we were served a very weak, luke warm coffees. We asked whether the coffee was a double shot and told all their coffee was double shot- we were quickly provided with an additional shot.  Enjoyable breakfast experience, excellent, friendly efficient service with disappointing coffee.I"

143,"We booked bottomless brunch but due to a few drinks the night before we decided to have the a la carte with a glass of bubbles. However, as soon as I saw the food come out I knew I’d made a huge mistake and have already booked to return for bottomless brunch! Trust me when I say… you need to go for more than just 1 course!!  The Dirty Daisy was insane and I am a foodie and don’t say this lightly…  This. Was. The. BEST. Breakfast. EVER!!  The pancakes look insane and I want them next time for sure!  The staff were so friendly especially the French speaking gentleman, Stefan - I was a little hungover so apologies if that wasn’t what you said.  100% recommend!"

Bottomless brunch includes a sweet and savoury dish each, plus bottomless prosecco for 90 mins I believe. Bottles were put on the table and as soon as they were finished were immediately replaced as they were put down empty by our group - rare for a bottomless brunch :) Service was great, our waitress Alexandra was new but fantastic and attentive. In fact everyone there who served us downstairs was good fun. We had such a fun time there and would recommend!"

174,"The best bruch in London, good food and good vibes. Nice friendly atmosphere. Great service thanks to Stefano :)"
175,"Visited this as around the corner from work. First you cannot fault the extensive menu and quality of food one little bit. I will be definitely recommending on that basis - innovative, fresh, good vegan options. It is also fair price for London in my opinion. We visited on a weekday lunch so not overly busy. We were put in a crammed corner upstairs when there was lots of available seating. Downstairs decor is the star of the show but they obviously wanted to keep that clean as there wasn’t enough customers for that (but if you book insist on that seating). The second point was the service - like I said not busy and lax in waiting on us - had to be called over several times when standing there chatting because they weren’t paying attention - complacency? London is not short of good restaurants so this really detracted from the visit."
176,"Nice food with interesting flavour combos. Friendly, helpful staff. Had the ‘dirty daisy’ and was very good. Keen to return and try more dishes."
177,"Great place to eat, fantastic breakfasts, I eat there 8 days straight as I couldn’t fault the service and food. Great menu with healthy options, best coffee I had in London"

199,"Good food,good drinks! And the bottomless was 10/10! Really recommend it!!!!! I had the pancakes with chocolate it was sooo good"
200,"This restaurant might be fine for brunch - it’s a different menu. But for an evening meal it is awful. We had tasteless entrees and the mains were poor too. Scarlett Green makes much of its Australian roots but none of the food that we had was recognisably so - apart from my husband’s chicken parmigiana and soggy chips, which reminded me of the sort of food produced in second-rate pubs and RSLs in the 1960s. Not nearly good enough and dreadfully overpriced. We won’t return."
201,"Scarlett Green has an incredible brunch. Our server was Stephan and he was really hospitable and could not have done more. Their brunch is incredible, really enjoyed the bottomless brunch with free Prosecco. Very good service and food. Would come again."

207,I went there for brunch with a friend one Friday. The food was absolutely delicious with generous portions and excellent service: attentive but not intrusive.
208,"10/10 would recommend. We came here for bottomless branch and were super impressed. We came here for the 90 minutes and ended up staying 4 hours. The food was amazing and so was the service. Stephan was the best host we could have asked for. He was so attentive and friendly, and as soon as one bottle of Prosecco was finished the next bottle was already on the table. The menu was great with many different options and stated what was gluten free."

222,My husband and I are visiting London from the US on our honeymoon! We are going to the Arsenal game and needed somewhere to go for breakfast. We googled places around our hotel we could walk to and we saw Scarlett Green and the menu looked great. We came around 9:30am on a Sunday and we’re able to get a seat no problem for the two of us. It got more crowded around 10am. The service was amazing. We did not have to wait and we’re greeted with friendly smiles. Our server Stephan helped us pick from the menu as we struggled because it all looked so good. I got the dirty daisy and my husband got the fancy bacon roll. The food was so delicious! Drinks were great. 100% recommend coming here! They have a bottomless brunch deal that looks amazing as well.
223,"The food was good, however they got our order on wrong twice which left one of us waiting to eat. Also low on other alcohol we asked for outside the brunch.. and the 20% service charge on top of just “ok” service was a little cheeky but we expected it. For the money we paid it was just ok. We won’t be returning"
224,"Excellent brunch, food was delicious would recommend the dirty daisy! Salsa our waitress was brilliant"
