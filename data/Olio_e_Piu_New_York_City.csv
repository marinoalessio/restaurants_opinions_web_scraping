13,I’m a regular at olio. Food is consistently top notch. Bolognese and carbonara are a must! Adam at the bar is great.
14,I couldn’t be more effusive with praise for this West Village situated Italian restaurant gem. It was wonderfully conducive for a romantic date. The food was delectable all around.
15,Such an amazing experience at Olie E Piu! We arrived around 9:45pm on a Sunday and were greeted by the kind hostess who promptly sat us. The atmosphere was lively yet suitable for a date night with soft music and beautiful lighting. Our server Adam assisted us with our ordering selection and his recommendations did not disappointed! The Burrata & Lemoncello Ravioli was delicious. And I also order Fusilli E Manzo for a second option. It too was absolutely delicious. Looking forward to my next vist!
16,"I liked the food the atmosphere is pleasant and cozy, the prices are good and our waiter Leandro had a very good service super attentive"
17,"Super cozy and the food is absolutely amazing! . Really nice Staff , waiter leandro is always cordial and super friendly! I recommend! would definitely come back."
18,"Let’s just say we were having a bad day and I came on trip advisor app to find a place which is warm, has good food and alcohol ( hey it’s Saturday !) and I have to say this place was THE BEST thing that happened to us during this weekend trip to NYC ❤️ let me start with the wine … Chianti was perfect pairing with the food, it was suggested by one of the warmest server I have met ( and I have travelled enough to say this … lol) Maria was kind and warm and detail oriented, thank you Maria for turning our day around ! Ok so back to the food the arugula salad was fresh and spot on and the pasta made me feel like I was at an Italian home …. Yet to have the desert … lol"
19,"The meal was fantastic and authentic, much like in Italy, which I adored. Excellent service was provided. The management and personnel made sure we had a wonderful day. We'll most definitely return!"
20,Loved eating at olio e piu! Had the margarita pizza and the sphagetti carbonara! Both amazing! Loved the service! Davidson was an amazing server and helped us with ordering!! Ashraf was also amazing!!! Will be back and next time I’ll be getting the lobster ravioli
21,"I was craving an expresso martini but not your typical vodka base ., i wanted jameson and after 3 fail attempts from local restaurants i found my new spot to bring friends and family! Adam the bartender was extremely helpful and made me what i asked for! The drink was delicious and satisfying.,  Will come again.,  Adam is the best"
22,Went here for a birthday dinner in December. Service is always great here and the food is amazing. Our fav place to eat in NYC. The pastas are so amazing. Only downside I would mention is I wish they had better desserts. Can't wait to go back!
23,"I had a great time in Italy, and the food here was authentic and delicious. The service was fantastic... The staff and management made certain that we had a pleasant visit. We will definitely return!"
24,Had a beautiful night with great service! (Thanks to Davinson and Ashraf). The fusilli e manzo are to die for and the fettuccine tartufo are a close second. The best desert was the vanilla pannacota with passion fruits. We took the bruschetta ricotta as antipasti but we were not impressed.
25,"Looks touristy but oh so good! Walked by this place for years and was not impressed but when finally tried it, food was oh so good. I had the pasta with black truffles, so good."
26,"Our server Adam was the best - friendly, attentive, and gave GREAT recommendations. The food and ambience were fabulous, too. Will be back!"
27,Our server Adam was AMAZING! Have great recommendations and was extremely attentive and kind. Highly recommend visiting!
28,"First time here, will definitely been back. Sat at the bar at lunch and it was so lively. Adam was friendly and gave us tons of recs. Awesome experience!"
29,Popped in to have some midday pasta with the wife. Bar is awesome and Adam (bartender) crushed our drinks and took great care of us.
30,"I just had lunch here and it was phenomenal. I had the Caesar salad, side of grilled shrimp, fettuccine with truffle and a cocktail. Everything was excellent. Adam the bartender took great care of me and even gave me wine to sample for pairing with my entree.  Will be back and I highly recommend"
31,"We really enjoyed our dinner here. We got the burrata and limoncello ravioli, the chicken entree, a Caesar salad, and the bruschetta. We also enjoyed the panna cotta and the chocolate sphere for dessert. So yummy! This is some of the best pasta I've ever had. Davinson and Ashraf took amazing care of us and were extremely attentive. We always had full water glasses and got great recommendations on all of our food choices. I can't wait to go back for both the impeccable service and the tasty food!"
32,Really tasty food (both the pastas and the pizza were amazing). Dessert as well! The atmosphere is nice and the service too :) kudos to Davinson and Ashraf!
33,"I loved everything! From the first moment we walked in, we were greeted with such positive energy. Our server, Maria, was amazing from the start. She made it clear about her extensive knowledge of the menu and helped us navigate the menu from the drinks to the desserts, etc. She was very much outgoing, welcoming, and professional. We loved every second of the our dinner and will do anything to make the visit from Jersey again sooner than later!"
34,"Amazing food, service and vibe. Our waitress Maria was top class. Highly recommend. Will certainly be coming here again."
35,Had a memorable dinner experience with my friends. We both think the food and drinks are delicious. Would highly recommend Spaghetti Carbonara. It came out so flavorful. Also a special shoutout to Maria the waitress. She made the whole evening enjoyable and cozy on this cold winter night.
36,This place is amazing. Best pasta in town. Perfect location and best service as well. Marija is awesome!
37,What a fabulous experience. We had no reservation but sat at the bar overlooking brick oven pizza making and the kitchen= pure artistry! Maria was our waitress. She was extremely attentive and personable despite the how busy she was. We watched chef Pedro Cruz smile and engage with staff while putting out tremendous dishes. The carbonara (gluten free for me) was to DIE for! My husband raved about his Fusilli E Manzo! We can’t wait to go back! See you then Maria!
38,"Visited tonight having booked a few weeks before our trip.  The fritto Misto was nice. Couldn’t fault it.  The rose wine was average at best. The IPA was also average.  Gnocchi was okay. Margherita was okay. Ravioli was far too lemony and sweet. Carbonara was tasty but was cooked with Parma ham as opposed to Guanciale or pancetta. Disappointing.  The restaurant itself was nice but the tables are packed in and it’s very, very loud. The service was generally okay.  To say this place is so highly ranked and the prices are high I’d say it’s disappointing.  $302 for 1 starter, 4 mains, a bottle of wine and 2 soft drinks is very expensive for slightly above average food.  Overall disappointed."
39,The food was great as well as the service and Maria was great. Awesome atmosphere and would highly recommend.
40,"Maria was a great waitress! Checked on us multiple times with kind service. Food was amazing and very nice ambience with holiday spirit. All the workers were fast and nice. Great place, would recommend to everyone!"
41,Amazing food and atmosphere. The service was great all thanks to Maria!!! We had an fantastic evening and will be back next visit to NY!
42,"The food, the service and the attention it’s great for a lovely time in family. New York has many good places and this it’s one of the best, Maria attend us and was such a good service and experience. 100% a must when you visit the town."
43,"Food was delicious and service was excellent. Our server, Maria, was very attentive and friendly. We all enjoyed our Christmas lunch here."
44,"Very nice place, but all our chairs were more or less broken so you were sitting in a hole. Food was ok but nothing outstanding and they did not strike us as very Italian. We have had much better Italian other places"
45,"Loved the ambiance at Olio, it was a perfect spot for a few girlfriends get together . I personally loved the tartufo pasta and the antipasti was great ! Would definitely return!"
46,"So disappointed, after reading the reviews we were really looking forward to our evening. The restaurant was freezing, as was my Irish coffee. Food was ok, but there are so many tables packed in you had to shout to try and have a conversation."
47,"Food was delicious from start to dessert! We had the Caesar salad, truffle fettuccine, tagliatelle Bolognese and tiramisu - however this needed a tad more booze! Great atmosphere! Victoria that served us was so bubbly and lovely, very attentive and has really looked after us this evening. Fabulous experience and service! Thank you!"
48,Everyone in party of four we’re all amazed at how well everything was prepared and presented. My carbonara was to die for my husband had a steak that he swears he’s never had one that good and we’ve been to a lot of places all over the world. Their panna cotta of different flavors were bomb.
49,"The Carbonara is a must. Don’t dare going there and not ordering it. Service is incredible! I’ve been 3 times already, and each time treated very courteously. Vitoria was helping our table last time, and she is extremely nice. Definitely coming back soon."
50,"We had an early reservation and when we arrived we were informed that the power went out. They asked us if we wanted to stay or come back another time. Knowing that we couldn’t come back and that the restaurant was fully booked for the rest of the evening, we decided to stay. We were seated inside at a very cozy small table. While we were waiting for the power to come back on, we ordered a couple of cocktails under the candle light at the table. It took about 45 minutes before the power came back on. We then proceeded to place our order. We ordered the fritta mista as an appetizer which was delicious and cooked to perfection. Our main meal was the branzino with broccoli rabe and the burrata lemoncello ravioli. Both dishes were perfectly cooked and delicious. I ordered a glass of Chianti but they were out so I substituted with the Barbara. That didn’t go well with the branzino. The gelato and espresso came next. The cocktails were complementary because of the power outage which was very nice to do that. The restaurant had plenty of seating, outside and inside and the staff seamed very courteous. We felt that this establishment was not as good as it was “hyped” to be."
51,"They act like the main event is the carbonara when the bolognese is where it’s at (one of the best I’ve had hands down) , is carbonara without guanciale or pecorino a real carbonara? Like I understand that those are expensive ingredients but if the chef would consider using guanciale instead of prosciutto (which essentially gives no flavour to the pasta which end up being glorified spaghetti with an egg based sauce) it would elevate that dish to what they claim it is…..and justify its cost"
52,"Olio e piu was incredible. The best carbonara I've had anywhere in the US! But beyond the food, Adam and crew at the bar were incredible. I know New York has some great Italian but this is one of the best. Will dine here anytime I'm back in NY!!"
53,My wife and I decided to go out to dinner after work. I saw the great reviews for this place and we went. Impossible to sit inside w/o a reservation. But the outside shack was quite warm and quiet. The food was excellent and the waitstaff fantastic. Faith and Shaleem made the whole experience special.
54,"Excellent Italian food! Was looking for a reasonable place to dine with the family. This place has great food and ambiance. We were technically seated outside but the part connected to the main establishment. There was a second outdoor section not connected, but heated and fully enclosed as well. Fear not the outside reservation in winter or inclement weather. I had the carbonara pasta and my kids had a pizza. Chocolate sphere for dessert. All delicious."
55,My husband and I stumbled in for dinner and we were blown away. Coming from an Italian girl - this food was incredible. Even better was the service (ask for Adam at the bar!). We will definitely be back.
56,"Our waiter this evening was Adam, he was very kind and welcomed us! Recommended the octopus appetizer and it was exquisite, definitely recommend coming here!! Very comfortable and cozy restaurant with great drinks and food."
57,"We Just had lunch here ..very Amazing restaurant where u can eat and drink italian food. The staff Is very good, in particolar we Met Maria that She took care of us with a lot of reccos, nice and kind. We appriciated everthing. Sabrina"
58,"Such a cute spot! Stopped in for a drink to plan our evening, we were a little worried we were under dressed but felt welcome and warm. Adam the bartender took amazing care of us and gave fabulous recommendations. 10/10 for atmosphere and drinks."
59,"Very nice place, good vibes, perfect service and the food: my fusilli pasta was simply outstanding (I am Italian)!! The dessert was also delicious and very elegant to see."
60,"We found this delightful restaurant by chance and absolutely loved our experience. The ambiance was superb, the food was delicious and our waitress, Maria was exemplary with her customer service and attention! We’ll be back!"
61,"I already knew the other restaurants of The Group NYC and to my surprise, the vibe at Olio e Piú exceeded my expectations! Good food, friendly staff. One of my friends was already a regular customer of the restaurant! The pizza was incredible. Looking forward to returning! Bravo, Emil and team!"
62,"This place looks great on the surface, decor, music, friendly staff and general ambiance. The prices are typical NYC however, the wait staff consistently suggested to other tables and mine that we should order appetizers, salad and a meal. Uhhh luckily I’m old enough to know better but the suggestive up-selling was rampant. I ordered the most expensive wine by the glass and could barely get it down before the next pressure sale happened. The food? It was good but not much better than average. The prices? Probably a bit high for the food but the place was cozy and really nice. Would I go back? Maybe, but so many other choices in NY and this staff is not happy unless u break $100/ a head!"
63,A very nice and cosy environment with tasteful dishes smiling and polite staff. The must plate is pizza diavola and the lime tortelloni
64,"I came with a friend to have some drinks and all I can tell you is that the cocktails are amazing, the bartender Renam is super friendly and will recommend the best drink!"
65,OMG !!! Every single thing we ordered was amazing!!! … and the service even more. Our waitress Gokce was so lovely and kind helping us decide what to eat and her recommendations were BiNGO!!!
66,"Local and have wanted to visit for a while, delicious fresh food, excellent wine list, fantastic service from Adam - will return!"
67,"We had a beautiful meal here after celebrating our wedding, Davinson was our waiter (he was brilliant, the fact I remember his name several days later tells me so) and, apart from the fact I kept getting my hair caught on the plant beside the table, it was excellent!!  We had the bruschetta ricotta and salmon tartare to start, carbonara and fusilli e manzo, my husband said it up there with the best pasta he's ever had. We had panna cotta and cheesecake (i did want the cheesecake but they'd run out) and it was awesome.  My only gripe, which is trivial, is that I'd mentioned when I booked that it was our wedding meal (and I turned up in my wedding dress) and they never acknowledged it with a congratulations or best wishes, which would have been nice! However, it didn't distract from a lovely meal!!  Highly recommend!"
68,"Adam & Renam - the ACE team behind the bar !!! At this unique, quiant venue in the historical West Village in Manhattan NY. The service is truly amazing and personalized with impeccable bartender skills. The food delicious as well.  A must visit when you are in town. Enjoy!"
69,"Olio e Piu is pretty good. The brunch menu is okay. You can do better elsewhere. However, the pastas and pizzas are great. The fried calamari/seafood platter is fun as well."
70,I came here to celebrate my bff birthday and I am impressed with the food and hospitality. My server Leandro was truly the sweetest and gave us the best recommendations. Everything was amazing. I definitely recommend olio e più to anyone in the west village area looking for Italian delicious food.
71,Wow everything was perfection! Our server Leandro was a pleasure! Everything from the appetizer to entre to desert was absolutely delicious! You will not regret coming to this restaurant cheers!
72,Definitely one of the nicest dinner places on the Village. Awesome Italian dishes and appetizers. The ambiance is very trendy and cozy and almost fill like a true Tuscan trattoria. Also Davidson and his wingman Ashraf were perfect on their attentions!
73,Soooooooo good!!!! Excellent diner!!! Davidson and Ashrafe went out of their way to make our evening memorable!!! Our daughter ‘s bday was awesome thanks to them!!!! The food was delicious!! The pasta was excellent and fresh!!! I will defenetly be back!!!!! Thank yoy!!!!!
74,"Great service, Marie our server was super nice and she gave us great recommendations! Sorry if I misspelled your name but you made our dinner! The place it’s self is so pretty. Wine and dessert was amazing!!! Will definitely be back."
75,"I was really excited to come since it's ranked #2. I did like the environment, but the service wasn't what I'd expect. Very hard to understand the waiter. My dinner (bolognaise) was very good. The bruschetta was not, we sent it back, and the ""board"" offerings were very slim, and the cocktail we tried was just ok as well. It was enjoyable enough, but I don't think I'd go back and I agree with another reviewer... I'm not sure how this is ranked #2."
76,The food is great but not sure how it ranks number two in all of New York. The grill octopus was so tender. Salmon cook to perfection and so was the sea bass. Very crowed and noisy.
77,"I’m from NYC, but moved away a bit ago. I would eat here at least once a month to treat myself because everything is so fantastic. Now OEP is a must visit every time I visit, I am always amazed by the food, and the speed and care of the service. The last four times I came my server was Ivana and she is beyond phenomenal. Thank you!"
78,"I almost never write restaurant reviews, but we met a waiter there today who had to be recognized publicly. Leandro was his name and he was phenomenal. He catered with attention and sympathy!"
79,"I had only the most wonderful time at Olio E Piu tonight. My mother is visiting town and I wanted to take her a great restaurant, and boy did they deliver. Our waitress Ivana was an absolute wonder, she was kind, funny, personable, and gave wonderful recommendations. Each time we were ready to order she appeared ready and made sure the food came out just as ordered and as quickly as possible. Not to mention that the atmosphere is intoxicating and the food is delicious. You’ll have to try to keep me from coming back! Biggest thanks again to Ivana: you made our night."
80,"Great service, great atmosphere, lovely food and wines! Thank's to David and Gabriel for excellent service🤩 Highly recommend this restaurant!"
81,"We made reservations on open table, showed up a few minutes early and requested they seat us outside. They did and split up 3 tables for 2. The people that were seated next to us arrived about 10 minutes later and got their food first. The folks seated next to us on our left also seated later knocked our bottle of water over and the wait staff watched and did nothing.... When we finally got our food it was good. The caesar salad was good but small, the gnocchi with pesto was good but not great, and small. The spaghetti carbonara was good but not great and small. The bread was good. All in we had a small salad two plates of pasta and 3 sodas and it cost 140 dollars. 21 dollars for 3 sodas......Way overpriced and crowded. The hype was not worth the experience. Not going back! Oh, now open table is saying that we did not check in so even worse for the service. Not quite a one star but getting there....."
82,"Everything was phenomenal! Food is amazing, and our server Ivana was impressive and so fun, she kept the energy up. All the things she recommended we took and we will be back soon!"
83,Enjoyed this Wonderful environment on our visit from Florida and had amazing food and Ivana D was amazing.
84,"This is place is amazing!!  There is such a nice vibe/atmosphere in the restaurant. We sat outside and every table was taken but the service was still amazing.  The carbonara was the best I have ever tasted, absolute perfection. The cocktails were also super yummy and unique.  This was one of our best meals when visiting NYC."
85,"I knew I had to come check out this NY location after trying Olio e Più in Vegas. I love everything about this place - the vibe, food, and service! It always gets packed so make sure to make a reservation beforehand.  Everything we ordered was extremely delicious. The carbonara would have to be my favorite. The pasta was perfectly cooked and it had just the right amount of flavor.  I'll definitely be back! Olio e Più is the real deal."
86,"We had lunch in there, the place was pretty packed on a week day, ambience was great, staff were very friendly and above all food was very rich in flavor … super tasty! Our waiter, Leandro, was very helpful and attentive  5 stars indeed … next time I am in NYC, I am coming again … See more on instagram @advice_bee"
87,"Olio e Piu was such a fabulous surprise. Not that I wasn't expecting it to be great, but my expectations were extremely surpassed. The cocktails (apricot martini drink was delightful) were so good and the food was so so good. I started with the artichoke salad- the cheese in it was so good. I got the gluten free short rib pasta for my entree and it was AMAZING. As someone who has celiac, the gluten free pasta tasted amazing and they genuinely cared about my allergy and double checked everything. I would definitely go back."
88,"I checked this restaurant out as it had good reviews on Trip Advisor and I wasn’t disappointed. Friendly, efficient service, absolutely delicious food, cocktails etc. I had ravioli with a limoncello sauce - followed by the panacotta with passion fruit and pineapple - exquisite!"
89,Our server was Ivann and she was very nice and attentive. Made sure we were having a good night and had everything brought on time. Really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant because of this service !!
90,"What can I say that hasn’t already been said, this place is incredible! The service is fabulous, the food is fresh, delicious and perfectly portioned. I can’t wait to come back on my next trip!"
91,"I’ve been to a lor of italian places in my life. Pizza is my favorite food. Never. LITERALLY NEVER have enjoyed as much as this one (not even in Italy). Order the truffle pasta, AMAZING"
92,"The experience was amazing, I went by myself for brunch and the server ( Victoria ) and all the stuff were so nice to me. Her service is professional, clean and very clear. The Prosecco that I took was perfect for being outside sitting 💖"
93,Dinner was amazing!! Leandro was a fantastic waiter! I would definitely come back again and again! The bianca pizza was delish
94,"Brought my 70 year old mother here (her 1st visit every to the Big Apple) to experience authentic Italian dining. We were not disappointed!! Amazing pasta. The best we've ever had!! Service was exceptional - Maria was awesome!!! Perfect ambiance - comfortable & cozy, and not pretentious. Trust me, you will not be disappointed!!"
95,"This charming Italian restaurant in the heart of Greenwich village will take your breath away. I have been wanting to try it for years, finally did and it absolutely did not disappoint. My fiancé and I went for date night, and we loved everything from the ambiance to the food to the classy service.  They make all their Pizzas and Pastas in-house so be prepared for an incredibly fresh meal. Highly recommend the carbonara and the black truffle pasta paired with red wine as they were so good, and for dessert you must try the Nutella Calzone and the chocolate sphere, they're absolutely delicious."
96,"This place has got to be one of the best Italian restaurants in NYC ! We had fish , pasta, pizza, dessert, and grappa to end the evening and were not disappointed. To top it off Nivea gave us excellent service and just made our experience that much more enjoyable . Will definitely go back!"
97,"Food was amazing. Service was beyond belief!!! Vittoria, our waitress was great. Highly recommend coming here specifically for our waitress Vittoria. She was the best!!! Best Italian restaurant in nyc !!"

103,"Lovely place, very fresh food and awesome drinks! When you come, make sure to look for Leandro or Nivia, they were so nice and provided us with great tips and indications on the menu!"
104,A few friends and I went there for lunch and it was perfect! The drinks are amazing and the food… no comments. The carbonara was excellent! Also we loved the service! Our servers were Leandro and Nivia and they are the best. Make sure to sit in their area! I’m definitely coming back soon
105,"Excellent Italian place in the heart of Greenwich village! Great location, great food, and great service. Our server Leandro was excellent! Will definitely make this a stop every time I visit the city!"
106,"Thisbe my second time here. I came back for the mushrooms and I did not like mushrooms till I ate the one from here. Service was amazing, Leandro is very friendly and was on his game! It was a very nice dinner. I will definitely come back for more mushrooms You rock Leandro."

112,"Restraint found by chance while strolling in Greenwich village turned into a nice experience. Everything including the service, food and ambiance was perfect. Jose was very attentive and gave us good recommendations about choices. We can't wait to come back. Strongly recommended if you want some authentic Italian food. Grazie mille"
113,I went out with some friends for my birthday dinner. An excellent time was had by all. Our server was excellent (wish I could remember her name to give her proper credit). The food was great. I had the black truffle pasta. It was a little salty but otherwise delicious. The panna cotta was also very good. The atmosphere was excellent. No complaints at all! Highly recommend!
114,Amazing experience. The pizzas are really good and Davinson offered us an excellent service. The desserts that he recommended were spot on! We enjoyed them!
115,Victoria is literally one of the best! I’ve been lucky to get her as my server two times now (I’ve only been here twice) and it’s always a pleasure. She literally always smiling and is super welcoming. This woman knows her stuff when it comes to recommending the best of the best. Highly recommend coming to Olio E Più - you will not be disappointed.

117,My sister and I went there for her birthday and we were definitely not disappointed! The food was delicious (I would recommend getting the truffle pasta) and the staff very kind.

118,"Amazing food and experience! I recommend getting the gnocchi pesto, it was excellent!! Victoria, our waitress was really friendly and made our experience so much better. Will be back really soon!"
119,"Please come here if you want good vibes, great wine, and quite possibly the best carbonara in NYC. This west village gem has great service (shoutout to Victoria!). Energy was amazing. Vibes were immaculate. 10/10"
120,Italy meets New York. Best atmosphere for Italian food in the city. Don’t leave without ordering the Carbonara.
121,Best dinner experience in the city! The Carbonara is the best pasta i've ever had in my life. And to top it off... had the most caring & charimatic server: THANK U VICTORIA!!!! Hope to get u next time we come visit :)
122,Victoria was an incredible waitress for our large group dinner. The food was absolutely to die for- haven’t had pasta this good since Italy!
123,"The restaurant is really cute, you can feel the real vibe of west village. I loved there carbonara and also very authentic diabolo pizza. Will definitely visit again. The experience got even better with wonderful service pf Victoria! Thank you!"
124,I visited with a friend and ordered the carbonara pasta and the spicy sausage pizza. The food was amazing and the ambience was so cute. But especially my server Victoria was so sweet and nice. Her energy was vibrant and such a pleasure to talk to. Definitely a must visit spot!
125,"First time at NY and couldn’t have experienced a better restaurant. It felt like I was in Italy with how authentic the food was. Amazing environment and service, our server Gabriel had answers to all my questions and had the best service. He made us feel welcomed and had amazing energy. Everyone should definitely try this place out!"
126,"Dined in with friends as a last hurrah before heading back to school. We chose this place because we’ve been in the past and we’ve only had a great experience. Our server tonight, Victoria, was very cheery and bubbly which made our experience uplifting. We ordered their most popular dishes, the Carbonara and the Tagliatelle Bolognese which were as phenomenal as the last time we had them. The portions were just right and the sauces were perfectly seasoned. Overall, we had an amazing experience and we will definitely come back again."
127,Came with a group of friends who were visiting and the server Victoria was very attentive and caring. The food was good and Victoria let us know what the popular dishes were and what were her favorites ending up with a great meal and desserts!!
128,Been here a couple of times and the food and drinks are always so good! The carbonara is actually the best carbonara I’ve had. And the service is great. I’ve been there right when the kitchen is about to close and during peak dinner time and the severs are so attentive (Shout out to Victoria).
129,Omg please come to this place. We had the ravioli and vegetarian pizza and both were amazing/ we cleared our plates completely. The service is amazing as well. It was crowded but they gave us our food in a timely manner and Victoria on their staff was such a sweetheart!
130,Had a blast! The food was amazing ! DELICIOUS. But the best part was my server. Camila was such a nice girl. She knew everything about the menu gave me a good recommendation for the wine. Amazing ! If you go there ask for her. You won’t be disappointed.
131,"Looking for a place to have dinner in NY, me and my boyfriend decided to stop by Olio e Piu, this beautiful Italian restaurant. Camila was our waitress and she was just outstanding. We wanted to share pizza for our appetizer and she recommended the abbondante which was just amazing! For our entrees, we had carbonara pasta and grilled ribeye that was also amazing!!! Our experience was everything we were looking for and Camila just made it even better! We will for sure be back!"
132,"My friend and I visited NYC and this is hands down the best restaurant we’ve ever been in!! Not only was it the best dish i’ve ever eaten, but the staff was even more amazing!!! Please, if you‘re visiting or even living here, GOOO!!! And ask to be seated at Victoria’s section if you can, she’s the best ;)"
133,Service was amazing! Victoria super nice and friendly. The bolognese was absolutely delicious - would come back again
134,"I’ve worked in the area for a few months and never noticed this place — a friend suggested we go here because it’d been on her list for a while and I’m so glad she did! The food is AMAZING, staff is super friendly (shout out to our lovely waitress, Victoria) and the vibes and scenery is really nice. It’s great for fam, friends, dates, etc! I definitely recommend. I had the abbondante pizza!!"

136,It is a lovely venue with great food and our server Gabriel was superb! Would highly recommend and will definitely be back :)
137,"We chose Olio e Piu to celebrate my daughter's birthday when we were on a holiday to NYC this July. It was hands down our favourite meal of our trip. The atmosphere, service and food were all exceptional. We had the truffle pasta, limoncello and crab ravioli and goats cheese gnocchi for our main courses and they were all fabulous. They brought a little treat out to wish my daughter happy birthday. Good vibes and a great decision to come here. Loved it."
138,"My roommate and I moved to New York a year ago and stumbled across Olio e Piú our first night in the city, a year later to commemorate our move we came back for dinner and had such an amazing experience! The food was incredible, the restaurant is so beautiful, and we had the pleasure of speaking with Victoria who made us feel incredibly welcome and looked after. Overall this was such an amazing experience so thank you!"
139,The food at Olio e Pui was incredible. Highly recommend the salmon. We had Victoria as our waitress and she was so bubbly and friendly and made the experience one to remember. Will definitely be coming back soon!!
140,Favorite carbonara in the city…. Perhaps the world? Victoria was a lovely waitress! She was so helpful and nice. My boyfriend drank 4 liters of water and she kindly filled it up every time it was empty. Also - the ambience is fabulous. I would recommend the outdoor or indoor seating - you can’t go wrong. Think fiddle leaf figs in your face.
141,I’ve been wanting to go to Olio E Piu for quite some time- I’ve heard amazing reviews. After finally visiting I can honestly say this by far is THE BEST Italian food I’ve ever had!

144,"This is the pest pasta I’ve ever had. I’ve been in NYC for three days checking out the scene to see if I’d want to move there for my masters, and up until now I didn’t want to move here. This pasta alone changed my mind. Now I’m seeing this city in a different light. I liked our waiter Victoria too. She was sweet and helped us choose what things are the best and boy were they! I love it here. If I’m ever back here this will be the first place I go!"
145,"Food was phenomenal, the crab meat ravioli was decadent, yet light and the mango drink was tangy, but strong. Ambiance was 10/10. And service, specifically the help from Victoria, transformed the experience into a complete culinary experience. Highly recommend"

156,"Delicious fresh pasta (we tried the carbonara and burrata lemencello), lively and cute dining atmosphere, and great service from Gabriel. A gem in the west village!"
157,My friend and I got buratta limoncello ravioli and carbonara for dinner. The carbonara was one of the most creamiest pastas I had! So delicious. Service was pretty fast and we had Gabriel M as our waiter. Definitely would recommend to friends

171,"Wonderful atmosphere, incredible food, unparalleled service. A great Mediterranean gem in an East Coast city. Victoria was wonderful."
172,I had a fantastic time here. The Spaghetti Chitarra alla Carbonara is a must have. (Make sure to mix the yolk in.)  My waiter Gabriel was amazing and took care of my every need. He made a fantastic white wine recommendation to pair with my pasta. Strongly recommended.
173,The only thing better than the delicious food was the amazing service! Victoria was a great waitress who elevated the entire experience
174,Olio e Piu is a beautiful Italian restaurant in the west village. The truffle fettuccine is divine and our waitress Victoria was fantastic! I will definitely be returning soon.

182,"Me and my friends came at 8 pm, the wait was not too long and the service was super nice! The restaurant is very cozy and vibey. The Fresca Pesto pizza I got was so good! The pasta my friend got was super flavorful and creamy, highly recommend. 这家的菜真的巨好吃，盲点也不踩雷，而且环境巨可爱很适合约会或者朋友们小聚，酒也很好喝，服务很好，真的很推荐啦！"
183,The pasta and wine was great! The pasta had so much flavor in it and really blended well together. The Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc was also a great plus.
184,"Went during a weeks trip to NYC from UK- it’s beautiful, food is insanely good and service perfect. We had Victoria as our server who was constantly looking after us and kind and friendly. We also had Edward, working in our area who was consistently topping up water and very sweet and caring! Thank you Olio E pieu for a lovely evening"

191,"I went to the restaurant with my boyfriend, we had such a nice dinner. The food is really good and tasty, Gabriel was our waiter and he was extremely kind and helpful. We had the carbonara and Nutella calzone for dessert, it was DELICIOUS!!! We totally recommend the place."
192,My wife and I had an early dinner reservation. The salads are good size. We ended up ordering a salad each and then splitting the bolognese. It was plenty.
193,"This place was amazing on all fronts. The ambiance is quaint, lot's of plants, seating is tight but arranged in such a way as you not sharing your neighbor's meal. We started with a Caesar Salad, usually hard to mess up, but even harder to make special - and this was. My wife had the Paccheri Nero which was delicious and I had the Burrata Lemoncello Ravioli. Was a little concerned about Lemoncello in a ravioli but it was perfect - there but not dominating the Burrata, just complimenting. We topped off the meal with a Terlaner from Cantina Terlano - a delightful blend of Pinot Blanc, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc. If you get the chance ask for Suzana - she was perfectly attentive and very knowledgeable about wines."
194,Really nice place and ambiance. Ordered a margherita pizza and it tasted really good! Service was great. Special thanks to our waiter Gabriel for his attention!
195,"Everything was great , Ambiance , Decor, Service and food . Ordered prosciutto, bureara e pecorino “sardo” , perfecto! Branzino al Olio , perfecto and Fusilli e Manzo , Perfecto! Gelato Perfecto !"
196,"Well, the staff was helpful and friendly, and the service was ok (between first course and the second we had to wait 40 minutes!) By the time our pasta finally arrived we were starving… and to our disappointment it was not good. Maybe we had such high expectations because it has become such a trendy place and the person who took us there wanted to go.  We have traveled to New York from abroad several times and having been to many other Italian restaurants much much better, we now know that this is one that we won’t be coming back to. Sorry."
197,Was a great experience and the food was really good. Especially the spaghetti a la carbonara and the campagnola pizza. Coming back next time I visit NY!!!
198,Is the first time here in New York and I came to visit for the first time here. Is an excellent place for you to eat. The Service of Gabriel was amazing. The food was spectacular. 100% recommended
199,"Olio e Piu is a great authentic restaurant, with the best pasta we’ve ever eaten. The atmosphere was buzzing and the service we received from Victoria and others was just as good."
200,"Good, not great. Very expensive. $375 for family of 4. Included wine and 3 cocktails. Cesar salads were very good. Pizza soggy. Chicken good although sauce was just ok. Carbonara very good. Gnocchi had good flavor, but chewy. Veal Milanese good. Service good, not great. Given 3 pieces of bread for 4 people. It was good, but not great."
201,I loved in Italy and the food here was authentic and delicious. The service was excellent…the staff and mgmt ensured we had a great visit. We’ll definitely be back!
202,Great and original italian food in NYC. Pizzas made in a wood-fired oven. Desserts are equally fantastic.
203,"Excellent experience. We had the tartuffo pasta and the pizza and both were great, although the tartuffo is a must! Place is nice, not too fancy but the food makes a great experience and is not pricy."
204,"The food, ambiance, and service were superb. Gabriel was a fantastic waiter! I definitely recommend for you to dine here."
205,"Gabriel was an excellent server. The food, service, and ambience was fantastic. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

207,Came here for our first night in NYC for my 30th birthday trip. It is quaint with a beautiful corner setting in the village. Great menu and wine! This place always sticks in my mind as a trip highlight.
208,"We had a great time at the restaurant. Very good vibes and incredibly tasty food. We enjoyed everything. Our waiter was super kind, helpful, and gave us grate service; Gabriel."
209,"Overrated. The food was delicious which I guess is what you come for, but the service was poor, the restaurant is very cramped which is uncomfortable and it’s extremely overpriced. It’s the kind of place you might want to try once but I definitely wouldn’t return."
210,"Came here on Tuesday night and it was packed, very pretty decorated, I think it would be a great spot to celebrate Mother's Day or any holiday here, also they do large groups dining. I really like their Calamari, they were very fresh and crunchy, drinks and desserts were beautiful as well. Definitely a hot spot in West Village."
211,No wait when we arrived. Great food and service by Victoria and the team. The carbonara and margarita pizza are amazing. Will be back soon!!
212,Was able to get a table on a Saturday for a late lunch - waitress Victoria was super personable and helpful. Second time here and already know I’m going to be back for a third!
213,"We got a table right away on a busy Saturday afternoon. The food was amazing and our server, Victoria, was so sweet!"
214,"I had hoped for more after reading the reviews, looking at the menu and considering prices should equate to quality. Food was ordinary. Most of the restaurant seemed to be eating the spaghetti Carbonera or pizza. We did not. The appetizers we had were predictable and lacked innovation . The gnocchi was clearly house made and different but lacked balance. The limoncello ravioli was very good. The ribeye was not good at all. Very fatty and grisly. Contorni promised more than they delivered. The roast chicken was definitely better. Service was great. Wine by the glass was pricy with a few cryptic names eg “ Super Tuscan” at $20/glass. Would I return? - No. It was just too mediocre for the money. There are better choices."
215,Visited here on our second day and loved it! The service was great and so was Victoria. 10/10 would recommend
216,"My friends and I went here before a night out and everything was INCREDIBLE! Food, service and vibes! Victoria was the best and really took of us!!"
217,Service and food were amazing! I couldn’t get enough of the bolognese. Victoria made sure we were taken care of. 10/10 recommend!
218,"Olio e Pui it’s honestly my favorite place to come. I’ve been here more than 3 times already and is always a come back. Dishes are delicious, the staffs attention is espectacular as usual! Victoria is always so nice and accommodating! It’s definitely a great experience and would always recommend to my friends!!"
219,"Amazing food and ambience, the decor is perfect for a date night or a family dinner. The carbonara and the caesar salad are to die for! Amazing service!! Make sure to ask for Victoria if you comee."
220,"From the charcuterie board to the carbonara, Olio was an experience from start to finish! Victoria was a delightful host and the ambiance sealed the deal! Would highly recommend!!!"
221,"Olio E Piu was an incredible experience! The food was mouthwatering. We had white pizza, seafood pasta and dessert. Everything was incredible. The cherry on top was the service from Victoria. She was so friendly and attentive. We recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to enjoy authentic Italian cuisine. We’ll definitely be back."
222,"ATTENTION FOODIES! This food was AMAZING. I had the truffle pizza, the squid ink pasta with seafood and the cheesecake tart. Out of this world. You guys will not regret it. Victoria was an amazing waitress! So friendly and attentive. Please make this your first choice."

230,"This restaurant would deserve a Michelin star! And special thanks to our waitress Ivana! From Garance, 9 1/2 years old, from France"
231,"The food here was indescribable…by far the best restaurant I went to on my visit toNew York. But what threw this place over the top, was the service from our waiter Davidson. He was extremely attentive, kind, enthusiastic and made excellent suggestions. Our experience with him has solidified that we are 100% coming back here on our next visit to NYC"
232,"Came here with my friend to have some amazing Italian food. Started off with the bruschetta ricotta and had the carbonara as an entree. Everything was amazing. The pasta tasted freshly made. Everything was greatly seasoned ( I highly recommend the bruschetta ricotta). I will definitely come back here.  Not only was the food and atmosphere amazing, but Victoria, our waitress was amazing. She made sure that we had everything we needed. Was very kind and personable which made the experience much more amazing."
233,"Came here with my best friend to catch up, she picked the perfect place. Service is amazing, ambiance is wonderful, and the food is top notch.
