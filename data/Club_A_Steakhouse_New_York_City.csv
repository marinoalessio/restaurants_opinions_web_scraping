25,"My wife loves to eat well-done filet mignons,and for me? Medium rare, but the owner of the Restaurant recommended us to share a Porterhouse and they brought it perfectly! Half cooked for her and half for me. Lovely place and excellent attention from Alfredo. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"
26,I definitely will come eat again at this place when I visit New York. The steak was very delicious and my friends and I absolutely loved it. Our waiter was very kind and friendly. If you are a steak lover this is your place.
27,Visited when over in NY from the UK for a long weekend celebrating our anniversary. After seeing the brilliant reviews I was very lucky to book a table online with less than a week’s notice. We were not disappointed. Great atmosphere and really attentive staff. We didn’t know until seated that the restaurant was participating in restaurant week so we got a fixed price meal so that was also a welcome surprise. Thick cut bacon starter was delicious I had the hanger steak with peppercorn sauce and it was cooked to perfection. Dessert (tiramisu) also fantastic. Staff couldn’t make you feel more welcome. Thorough t recommend.
28,"Honestly a fantastic New York gem. The team are all stars of service and the food matches. The decor, ambiance and food is amazing. The Porterhouse for two is a must try."
29,I was looking for a steakhouse to have dinner with my son before visiting the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. So happy I found Club A. Great food and service. I will certainly have a porterhouse their again.
30,"We decided to eat at Club A as the reviews were great on Trip Advisor. I was unable to book online from the UK as the dates on the calendar had not been opened. I emailed the restaurant and they booked us in early. When we arrived at the restaurant, the staff were welcoming and thanked us for coming to their city.  The food was out of this world. I had the filet mignon and my husband had the double pork chops. Both meals were excellent. The service was simply excellent. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. This is a must when visiting New York City."
31,"Fantastic restaurant- great staff and excellent food - porterhouse is a must, Nice bit of jazz to give a festive backdrop to family Christmas Eve dinner"
32,"This place is really what it says it is. Amazing hospitality, something you will not encounter in any other restaurant not only in NY or North America, very rare in Europe. We were welcomed as family. We immediately felt that this in not a typical steakhouse or a restaurant which we normally see in NY so eat take your bill and off you go, next one. The owner takes every free moment of his time, which he spends on welcoming guests, to check how everyone is doing and if everything goes well at the tables. You really feel like you are at your family dinner. Food is delicious. One of the best steaks we had in our travels to North America. Very nice wine card with a wide range to choose your favorite one. And the staff will never allow that your glass is empty . To the owner Bruno and the whole staff, thank you for having us on 23rd Dec, we felt very good there and whenever we come back to NY for sure we are going to revisit your restaurant."
33,"We went on a Wednesday night around 7pm, the food was amazing and well worth visiting. One of the best steaks I've ever had (fillet)!  Booking a table is must even on a mid-week night. The restaurant was packed and we seemed to visit at the busiest time which meant the order was slow and the service was not 100% but the food more than made up for it and we celebrated a birthday so they gave us free dessert and a card with a photograph for us to keep which was lovely."
34,"What an amazing restaurant, brilliant atmosphere, fantastic food. We shared a porterhouse steak and it was cooked to perfection."
35,"Nothing more to add than that. Will definitely come back the next time we are in New York. Thanks, Club A!"
36,"Delicious dinner at a beautiful venue with the best service. From the moment we made the reservation this was a wonderful experience. Excellent location..Welcoming hostess, nice jazz band as you walk in, delicious drinks, super wine list MOUTH WATERING steaks, side dishes and desserts … can’t believe we had not visited before. We will be back!!!!!! Thank you"
37,After sitting in traffic I finally arrived at the restaurant and I could not wait to have a cocktail…I walked in and I took off my coat and me and my husband tried to sit at the bar….the rude hostess said you can’t sit at the bar you have to go right to your table…she said we only have one person to make drinks for the entire restaurant… I was not happy!.. We go to our table and order a drink and wait for our friends to arrive… it took 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive…we ordered steak and oysters.. they should provide little forks for oysters and they do not have mushrooms on menu for a side dish.. my martini did not have a toothpick to hold my olives so I needed to scoop out with fork.. our steak was good.. but there are SO SO many other better steak houses in NYC.. Club A is a one and done for me!
38,"We chose this place for our 15th wedding anniversary after a recommendation. It’s a very authentic New York Italian steak house. The ambience is great, the service good but the food is incredible. We had the Porterhouse steak which melted in the mouth, beautifully  We met all the staff and owner who went out of his way to make my family very welcome and acknowledge our anniversary with a lovely card and picture. It was a night to remember.  They provide complimentary desserts which are a nice touch. Again, all round superb meal and evening.  Highly recommended!"
39,"We booked for a birthday celebration, we weren't disappointed. Mr Bruno made sure everything was perfect. I asked for extra anchovies in my Caesar... Got 5!  Hanger steak flavourful and filets mignons were tender. Delicious creamed spinach and macaroni and cheese Real NYC steakhouse experience, red walls, low lighting. Desert with candle and surprise... A free souvenir photo, what a nice touch.  Our $ doesn't go far and we managed to get a very good Groupon to make it even better. It included 2 bottles of red wine... ALL and all a good deal with good service."
40,"We recently held a holiday dinner for our executives. It was perfect. The private room on the second floor is truly private, large and nicely decorated. Bruno and his staff were incredibly welcoming. The restaurant had menus printed out with our logo for a special touch. We ordered several seafood platters for the center of the table for people to enjoy while they selected from the menu - each person chose an appetizer and entree. We ordered sides to share across the table. All were delicious. The wine selections were impressive and reasonably priced. I would highly recommend this spot for your private party."
41,"Without a doubt one of the best steak restaurants we have visited, the food was only surpassed by the incredible Service. We shall return when we are next in NYC, thankyou to the whole team and keep up the great service Paula and Eddie"
42,Service was extremely slow. They took my husbands ice tea glass twice without asking him if he wanted more. The food was “eh” okay. We waited for 15 minutes after the table was cleared and had to finally wave someone down to ask for the check. To which the reply was that they were bringing us dessert on the house. Yeah? That’s not what I wanted. Would never return. Was disappointing when I had read good reviews.
43,"Went to this cozy steakhouse on a solo trip on the recommendation of many friends. Great steaks and delicious side dishes. Attentive but not overly serviced. The price of the menu is also very attractive, and I will definitely come again next time."
44,Amazing place! 😍 We popped in on apure coincidence but oboy where wr happy! 3rd restaurant in New York and we are coming back. 😍😍 Nick is very handsome and nice 😍 As is also the owner/host.
45,"During our visit to NYC i wanted to treat my new fiance to a special meal for her birthday. After doing a bit of research I came across club A steakhouse on TripAdvisor and after seeing the great reviews I decided to book. The experience was amazing, we were looked after from the moment we arrived and they even went out of their way to ensure my fiance had extra special treatment on her birthday. We went for the crab meat cocktail & oysters to start- both were amazing. To follow we had the porter house steak and would definitely say its the best steak we have ever tasted. To finish off our delicious meal we were given complimentary deserts which were out of this world. Would hugely recommend this steakhouse.. you will not be disappointed!!"
46,Myself and my fiancée were visiting from Ireland and visited Club A to celebrate our engagement. We were immediately greeted with congratulations after specifying our reason for dining out which was an excellent touch and we felt very welcome! Our servers could not have been more helpful and attentive and made our experience very pleasant. The steaks were some of the best we have had and are worth every Penny! Without prompting a staff member took our photo and gave it to us with a personal letter to make the experience even more special and memorable! When visiting NYC we will definitely visit again! Amazing stuff!
47,"We found Club A on TripAdvisor, after looking for somewhere to eat during our stay in New York. It’s nice and central, but tucked away far enough from the bustle of Manhattan to offer a nice evening of relaxation, away from what is very much an intense, busy city. Out first impression was that the staff were warm and welcoming, and the decor was beautiful. We were served by Diego who you could obviously see takes pride in his work.  There is a great and extensive wine list with so Many to choose from, especially when it comes to Red Wine.  We ordered the New York Strip and Salmon. Both were cooked perfectly, very flavourful and you could tell were of outstanding quality. After we had finished, we were contemplating whether or not to order dessert, but then Diego bought out a delicious platter of three dessert’s to share with their compliments. It was honestly a very nice touch and it topped off what was such a fantastic dining experience."
48,"I’m from Texas, and we have great steak restaurants all over the place; however there is a reason why this is the #1 restaurant in NYC by Trip Advisor followers. It has been locally owned for 44 years, and the owner still comes around to your table! The food was top notch. My ribeye was one of the best tasting and best prepared, I’ve ever had! (And I’ve had a lot of them around the country. We will be visiting this place again!"
49,"Suberb quality food , possibly the best porterhouse ever…lovely to meet the owner and all the personal touches, great family business, we wish for them continued success."
50,Number 1 on trip advisor for new york does not disappoint. Everything about our visit to club a steakhouse was perfect. The owner and his story is amazing and you can really feel this at the restaurant. The food was out of this world! All the staff were attentive and it was a perfect end to our visit from England.
51,"Just returned from a wonderful evening at Club A Steakhouse. From the moment we walked in, we were already impressed by the warm, friendly yet professional welcome we received. The waiter was very helpful and talked us through the menu. We opted not to have a starter as we had read the previous reviews and didn't want to spoil our appetite, so we chose the Porterhouse for 2, and it didn't disappoint. It was perfectly presented and cooked to perfection. I also chose the fries that were delicious, and my partner had the baked potato, which, I am told, was also first class. As it was my birthday yesterday and my partners tomorrow, we were presented with a very nice complimentary treat of an array of mixed deserts on a ""happy birthday"" plate complete with candles.. We were also then met by Bruno, the owner, who presented us with a picture of us at the table on a signed card, which was a lovely gesture. Without a doubt, this was the best steak we had both ever eaten, and we would (and will) definitely visit again when we are next in the area. The only thing we didn't need was the salt and pepper as the steak was so perfectly seasoned it didn't need anything added to it. Please do yourselves a favour and visit Bruno and his wonderful restaurant. I am sure you will be as pleased that you did as indeed we were. Many thanks to all again."
52,"Not sure if we just happen to get lucky but quite possibly one of the best meals I have had in NYC or anywhere for that matter. Quaint restaurant where we we greeted by a friendly face as soon as we walked in. A gentleman who we learned was the owner also welcomed us as we were checking our coats. The pace, timing and everything was on point. We have some delicious oysters, a reasonably priced wine, a filet for me and lamb for my wife. We were trying to decide on appetizers and rather than push us to order too much, our waiter suggested that if our sides were not enough that he would get us another promptly, quite the opposite of many NYC restaurants where we were pushed to order way too much. Bravo Club A! The steak could have almost been cut with a fork, very flavorful without too much salt, just outstanding! And the lamb was amazing! Being our first visit they brought us a dessert on the house! Wow, just unusual and outstanding. HIGHLY recommend. We spent more elsewhere and received half the experience of Club A."
53,Family trip to The Big Apple went to this comfortable steak restaurant. Great steak and delicious sides. Attentive but not over bearing service. Menu priced so that dinner doesn’t break the bank. Look forward to a return visit.
54,"Nice place. Confident, welcoming and professional manager. Our waiter was negatively sarcastic and not professional. Welcome mushroom tordello (good). Mac&Cheese side was good. We took a decision to change and go for something different, cheeseburger. Arrived with no cheese and no sauce. Took the burger back, added some cheese, and managed to burn it. The burger, as meat taste, was not appreciated. Again, the waiter, indirectly un polite and sarcastic. The manager, professional, compt the burger (cheese). Would absolutely not recommend a cheeseburger l. Probably their steaks could deserve a shot."
55,"An absolute must, no wonder it’s so highly rated!! Visited for my husband 50th birthday celebrations, everything was spot on. We ordered a porterhouse, didn’t realise how big it would be, would have skipped starters if we knew, the taste was amazing!! Wine is expensive we stuck to the good range of beers and IPA . Complimentary deserts was a nice touch."
56,"Excellent in all terms: atmosphere,food,service,at reasonable prices !Gorgeous cut of steak,perfectly rendered,juicy!The omnipresent owner treats his clients as family guests!"
57,"I really can’t tell what was better the service or the taste, everything was so delicious and delightful. Not too much to say other than everything was perfect!!!"
58,Top quality Porterhouse steak and Rib Eye! Great service and an affordable winelist for NY! A great thank you to the A-Club team!
59,"Absolutely amazing. We ate here the last time we were in the city and decided to visit again for our 10th wedding anniversary. They really make such a lovely effort, the owner even visits your table several times. The food is exquisite and the wine menu is extensive. My favourite porterhouse - can’t wait to come back, thanks for a memorable evening."
60,"We were expecting more based on the reviews. Steak was good, nice enough place but trimmings few and far between. This was literally steak and fries. Prawn starter was three extremely large prawns with a ketchup dip and a seafood dip. The food was pretty unimaginative but the bill with a few drinks was still $150+."
61,Beautiful food - porterhouse the best steak we have ever had. Service really great! Yes it’s slightly speedy but would recommend to anyone looking for a great meal.
62,"Food ( porterhouse steak) was very good. Dessert was complementary ( there is no dessert menu). It looks like the waiters are in training process, but they were polite and nice. Recommended."
63,"Absolutely wonderful meal and service. Our pic was taken and we received a beautiful dessert. Bruno, the owner, came by and was great. He appreciated our business. Highly recommend."
64,Excellent porterhouse steak and mash potatoes. I also enjoyed the white wine. Excellent customer service and i even got to chat with the owner of the restaurant. Very cool and down to earth person.
65,Fantastic dinner - the seafood platter was amazing and the steaks were all very well cooked and succulent. Great atmosphere and service from Diego with special attention from Bruno. Well worth a visit if you the chance.
66,"Wonderful The restaurant owner, Mr. Bruno (we are from NC), was so kind and especially warm to my two young daughters. The server also served well and friendly. If you want to taste the best steak in New York and have a fantastic time with your family, visit here It's the best. 뉴욕 최고 스테이크 맛집입니다. 특히 가족분들과 시간을 즐기시기에 안성맞춤입니다. 가게의 오너분인 브루노 씨는 저희 딸들에게 너무 따듯하게 맞아주셨습니다."
67,One of the best steak ever in a very nice atmosphere with live music Our anniversary was super celebrated with a delightful surprise.. We will definitely come back ….
68,"I enjoyed this steakhouse very much. As you enter the restaurant you get a really cool old school steakhouse vibe. Feel like old New York inside. I love it. The hostess was super the nice and our waiter and staff was the best. They were very attentive and treated us amazing. We felt like family. The owner was going around ensuring that everyone was enjoying there meal and he was very personable and entertaining. The food, we order the porterhouse for 3 was simply amazing. Super delicious cooked perfect medium and very juicy. We ordered Creamed spinach fries and Mac n Cheese; all 3 were delicious. I definitely recommend this restaurant if your looking for a great steak with super vintage authentic NYC vibes. Cheers!"
69,What an amazing experience from start to finish!!!! We had a 3 hour meal and the food was fabulous!! The owner greets you when you walk in and you are treated like royalty throughout the night! Great wine list and cozy atmosphere. We will be back again!!!
70,"Fabulous service, best we have experienced in our week in New York! Complimentary appetiser and dessert topped off what was already a delicious meal. Steaks were cooked to perfection and sides were very nice and generous in size. Reasonably priced for the quality of the food and the service. Will definitely return when in New York next."
71,"Just had the best steak dinner at Club A for my 50th Bday. Food and service amazing- very thoughtful hosts, thank you!! :)"
72,We were celebrating our honeymoon and notified the restaurant in advance. When we arrived the first thing they said to us is congratulations on our marriage with a big smile which was nice. We were sitted next to the window where we could see the street. The appetizers were delicious but the porterhouse that we ordered was amazing! They took a photo of us and gave us it with a card congratulating us for our marriage!
73,"This was worth the trip to NYC! From the second that we walked in, to having the owner shake our hand as we left…. Phenomenal experience. The food was absolute perfection, the Chilean sea bass was to die for! The birthday dessert made my husband’s birthday celebration so special, thank you!"
74,"I don't want to share our entire experience because I don't want to set a bar so high that it cannot be met for other guests. Suffice it to say that we were treated like royalty by the ownership despite not knowing them. It was our first visit to NYC, first night on the town, and we were not disappointed.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, as was everything. The standout dish was the bacon appetizer which knocked our socks off. We loved the photos on the walls, the red decor, and especially the live music. We asked them to surprise us with cocktails and every time they were fantastic, even with liquors we typically hate (tequila).  I can't say enough good things. Definitely worth stopping by."
75,"On 10/6 I was in NYC with my immediate Family for a surprise getaway for my Mother's 70th birthday, and had reservations at Club A. Our experience was top shelf from beginning to end, and needless to say my Mom was beyond thrilled with the experience. Our wait staff was fantastic, and the meal equally as amazing. I had placed my rsvp via OpenTable and the staff at Club A was 100% prepared for us to celebrate the special occasion at hand. Bruno was extremely pleasant attentive to all tables, and personally visited us twice to ensure everything was up to par. We even received a complimentary photo to mark the evening for years to come. We'll definitely be back, thanks to the entire Club A staff for an evening to remember!"
76,"We’re from Australia, a family of four, and really enjoyed some of the best steak we’ve ever tasted. We shared: - the rib eye on the bone - the New York strip; and - double eagle strip.  Great food and great experience. If you love steak and in the area, I’d highly recommend going here."
77,"We are a family from Australia who came to New York. Yeh four of us shared the NY strip, the rib eye and the double eagle strip.  Club a steakhouse honestly impressed us in so many different ways. Not only did their amazing steak impress us, but also the amazing hospitality of both the staff and the owner. Seriously an amazing experience and could not express how much I recommend this place. AMAZING RESTAURANT MUST TRY!!!"
78,"Nice vibe, food and people. Hospitality is high. The steaks were very juicy and well grilled! thanks for the very pleasant hospitality and the picture!"
79,"Very good meat and large portion...but gosh it is expensive ! (count almost 100€ for an eye rib steak and a side, no wine counted) good wine but not a single french wine on the menu , which is wired for a steak house! Nice and kind staff"
80,"Very beautiful place with delicious food! I recommend to visit all the people that visit New York! Thank you, a very great albanian Mr.Bruno Selimaj! Dr.Adriatik Berisha Prishtinë, Kosovë"
81,What a great experience! Steak (porterhouse and ribeye) and sides (pureed potatoes and Mac and cheese) were delicious. Waitstaff were wonderful!
82,"The greeting was excellent. The bar entry is friendly, warm and inviting. The staff is friendly. The timing of service was spot on. The fillet was generous in size and perfectly cooked to the desired temp. The staff was accommodating and anticipated then fulfilled all the needs of the night without prompting. This was an excellent experience and one that I will have here again.  Highly recommended!"
83,"Had a family birthday celebration this past Wednesday. I always like restaurants where the owner is usually present, it almost always results in superior service and quality, Club A is no exception. Our reservations were honored and were gracious to a late arriving member of our party. The waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable even with an excellent wine suggestion. Our party had the lamb chops, filet mignons and the New York Strip. All were served as ordered and were absolutely terrific. The owner check stopped by our table to check on our meals and engaged us in conversation over the many photographs on the wall behind us. It was my wife's birthday and the restaurant presented a tray of deserts as well as taking a picture of our table with the owner signing and dating the accompanying frame. We were just blown away by the service, atmosphere and welcoming nature of the restaurant. We would highly recommend it."
84,"Truly a perfect dinner. Very friendly team with a nice unobtrusive service. The porterhouse steak perfect grilled, a dream! I recommend for the next to offer Fleur de Sal as a possibility not just salt. Between appetizer and entree a housemade ravioli with mushroom in a light cream, whow! Everything well done! And as we have been in the Club A for the first time, we got a nice sweet surprise! Thank you Bruno and the Club A team for an absolutely fantastic evening!"
85,"This place is the best! Staff are so incredibly professional and accommodating. Service is seamless. A friend and I stopped in NYC on our way back to Nova Scotia for a few days and had reservations prior based on the great reviews. We were not disappointed. The steak, sides and wine were delicious. I spoke to the owner during our meal and he gave us a brief history about owning the restaurant, such a kind sweet man. The space is small but very comfortable. It was probably one of the best restaurant experiences I ever had. I will be back and will be recommending to anyone visiting NYC."
86,My daughter made reservations at Club A and I was wondering what we would find. What we found was the best steak I had ever eaten. The facility was very nice and the service was outstanding. I would recommend the restaurant to everyone and plan on going back when I am ever in the Big Apple. Everyone in our group enjoyed the experience.
87,"Excellent!! Perfect birthday dinner!! The steak was cooked to perfection!! The restaurant was beautiful. Above all, the service was outstanding! And then to top it off, I was treated to a birthday surprise of delicious desserts!! I will return if I get back to NYC!!"
88,"We visited Club A Steakhouse for a special birthday dinner. The fillet mignon, salmon, salads, and more was exceptional! Delicious! The kind folks at Club A Steakhouse made the night extra special when they brought out a lovely birthday dessert. YOU should eat there too. Make a reservation to sit upstairs and go enjoy the kind of dinner you wish for. Club A Steakhouse for the WIN!"
89,"I am visiting New York and some friends for my 50th birthday. My friends also celebrating their 12th wedding anniversary, They are regulars and decided to take me to Club A Steakhouse!! They made a reservation at 5pm and from the moment we walked in, we were greeted by everyone! Their words about how much they respect and value the customer on the back of their menu caught my eye, and I immediately told my friend wow..I love that, and they totally displayed that throughout our time there!! They are very hands on and attentive!! We ordered the porterhouse for three and it was very good and plentiful! Their oysters, according to my friends, are some of the best they’ve ever had. The sides we had are broccoli, mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese, all very good. But the service was impeccable!! We were served a mushroom dish on the house!! My friend had some wine that she loved!! And the owner came by several times to make sure we were doing ok. The ambience there is very nice, perfect for any celebratory occasion!! And as we celebrated, our waiter and staff honored the celebrations by delivering two deserts with plates decorated wishing us a happy anniversary/birthday!! I absolutely loved this! Not only did they give us the dessert but they took a picture of us and printed it out with a Club A Steakhouse frame to thank us for choosing to celebrate our occasion with them!! This is what I’m talking about!! Now you ready for the last too nice too cool of a gesture, the owner brought us our picture and sighed it for us!! Really such a nice pleasant experience!! I’m so big on customer service and this place is so good!! I loved it and would go back if in town again!! A highly recommend in my book!!! Thank you to Club A Steakhouse Owner and Staff for taking such great care of us and to my friends for sharing their anniversary and this beautiful restaurant experience with me!!"
90,Steak was good. Wide selection of wine. Servers knowledgeable of the menu. We had a great time. Place was a bit dark (for me).
91,"Married in NYC on 15th September 2022 and wanted a New York Steak for our wedding meal. Did a lot of research and chose Club A Steakhouse as it had a good menu and looked to be an established steakhouse whao looked after their customers and we weren’t disappointed. The steak was amazing and the customer service first class from the time we entered to when we left. We received complimentary mushroom ravioli which was divine and complimentary desserts for our party of 9 with congratulations written on the plate. At the end we received a photograph memento signed by the owner which was a really nice touch. We couldn’t have wished for a more perfect end to our wedding day. Thank you Club A Steakhouse, so glad we came to you for our special meal . Highly recommend."
92,We enjoyed the Porterhouse for two it was cooked to perfection. Service was attentive and seamless. Would definitely recommend
93,"We had a wonderful dinner at Club A on Friday Sept 8, 2022.  We had a reservation for 7 and were running late on account of NYC traffic. I called and told them and he said not to worry - take our time.  The steak was excellent and we were stuffed and were not going to order dessert but a complimentary dessert arrived at the table. It too was delicious.  They treat you like family. Would definitely return."
94,The restaurant is very good with a wide variety of food and very friendly staff. I recommend it. Excellence
95,Celebrated my mom’s birthday here and she said it was “the best dinner of her lifetime.” The Club A staff goes above and beyond to deliver the best service from the second you enter the door by treating you like family. The food is phenomenal! The quality of the seafood and meat is top notch and the service is amazing. We will definitely be back!
96,"A Club Steakhouse is a great place for enjoying a wonderful special dinner. The location is vey classy and warm. The steaks are truly amazing, we tasted the porterhouse, which we will remember forever. Last but not least, the service was really good and our waiter Nick was really capable and pleasant. Really recommended if you wanna eat the best steaks in NYC. If it is your birthday, a surprise will wait for you! Ps. The day before our visit, Nadal had dinner here too."
97,"Absolutely loved this restaurant. We were visiting NY for 5 days and did a lot of research before going, including checking out Tripadvisor. This restaurant is listed number one restaurant in NY on TA which surprised me as I thought a ranking of that level would go to a restaurant with at least 2 Michelin stars but I was wrong. Everything about this restaurant was lovely from the setting to the presentation and the fantastic staff who took the time to explain all the food to you in very honest terms - our waiter even told me that I might find the New York strip a bit tough but I had it anyway and it was the most succulent tender steak that I have had in years!!! My wife had the filet mignon (fillet steak to us Brits) and it was absolutely incredible, so tender it cut like a hot knife through butter. My daughter had the cheeseburger which was lovely and the chips were incredible. I had booked in advance as it was my wife’s Birthday and the restaurant brought us complimentary cheesecake, tiramisu and profiteroles. The restaurant owner was an absolutely lovely guy who made a point of going up to every table just to say hello and thanked us for visiting - ordinarily I would find this a bit uncomfortable but he was an absolute gent and obviously very interested in his clientele. Total bill including 20% tip was $274.37 and it was worth every cent - if I ever go back to NY I would 100% return to this restaurant."
98,"It was a wonderful experience from start to finish! For starters, our highlight was the thick cut bacon. For accompaniment there is a really great selection of wines - for the main course we had the porterhouse steak for 2. I really have never had such a great steak! The service was very great class and is unparalleled, as a souvenir we even got a photo to take home - it was perfect all around and is a clear recommendation! Thank you so much - five ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
99,"Once again this did not disappoint. 4 years since we were last here and food and service as good as ever. From the waiting staff to the owner, everyone was lovely and helpful .As for the food - phenomenally good too . Deserves its number one position"
100,Great experience from start to finish. The hosts are classy & welcoming. Waiter provided good advice on the menu & top service overall. Food was exquisite. Meat is matured & premium quality. Surely one of the best if not the best steakhouse in NYC. I will definitely come again.
101,I visited this restaurant for my parent’s wedding anniversary. It was the last dinner of our trip and it was amazing. People were friendly and the steak and salmon was very nice. I recommend here for people who want to celebrate a special day.
102,"Amazing! In every sense of the word. On our second trip to NYC, we wanted to get that quintessential New York City steakhouse experience and Club A Steakhouse exceeded our expectations. The food is absolutely delicious, the ambience is absolutely fantastic, and the service is absolutely excellent! We were seated by the owner and unsuspectingly found out later that night, the humbleness of being in the midst of all the action and gathering first person insight means that this steakhouse is treated with care. Would highly recommend!"
103,Not sure how this is the no 1 rated restaurant in NYC. We are from the Midwest and have had much better steaks. The service was not the best I’ve had either. Drinks were decent. For the price and other ratings I expected more.
104,"Food is fantastic, staff is great, owner Bruno with family is very, very friendly. Must have been here 20 times over the years and their food is still the best. Had Restaurant Week yesterday ($60): sallad, Filet Mignon with potato puree and Tiramisu. All top notch as usual and their homemade steaksauce is fantastic Have been to pretty much all steakhouses in NYC: Keens, Benjamin, Club A, Delmonicos, Del Frisco, Sparks, BLT Steak/Prime, Quality Meats, Strip House, Wolfgang, Smith & Wollensky, Capital Grille, Frankie And Johnnie and a few more I don't remember and Club A is still Number 1"
105,Many thanks to Bruno and his wonderful staff who went out of their way to make our evening so special. Food was first class. We will definitely be back next time we are in NYC.
106,"Wow. What an amazing dinner at the best steakhouse in New York, amazing service, fantastic quality food and a genuinely nice food experience. Highly recommended"
107,"Our best restaurant experience in New York. We had a lovely evening, been welcomed by the owner that is professionally active about every detail in the restaurant. The food is great, fair price, great atmosphere."
108,What an amazing night I have spent with my family in this beautiful restaurant! Everything was really special… from the welcoming of Bruno and his staff to the outstanding quality of food and in particular of meat. If you are looking for a steak house in the centre of New York this is the place for you. PS : Perfect rythm in serving the plates and a really warm and family atmosphere.
109,"The best Filet Mignon in New York City, the hole experience was amazing Everything was just perfect and the owner was so sweet and attentive we were very pleased and will recommend this restaurant to everyone that love a good steak in a very relaxing environment with the best customer service !! Alicia Michel"
110,"My wife took me here for my birthday. Between the 2 of us we had the Smokey bacon, fillet Mignon, ceasar salad and a great plate of desert. Bruno and the waiters were very hospitable and will definitely go again if we ever get back to New York !!"
111,"Definitely the best meal I’ve ever had, from the atmosphere to the huge steak everything was perfect. The best restaurant in NYC."
112,"It would be hard to dine in a regular restaurant after eating at Club A.  The food was amazing! Everything in this place is at the highest quality. The owner, Bruno, pays attention to every detail: how to place look, how the tables are organized, how the waiters are available all the time but do not bother you. And the result -- an exceptional place."
113,We visited several restaurants during our stay in NYC with the Club A Steakhouse being our favourite. Service was outstanding and food amazing. Had a good offer on for three courses and wine which we took advantage of. I would highly recommend this restaurant particularly for special occasions. One of the best steaks I have ever had.
114,As always this place delivers on highest possible level and still doesn’t overwhelm you with the quite usual NYC (steakhouse) pressure to consume more. This family run restaurant simply is above anything! I come here since 7y and they NEVER disappoint!
115,"On my birthday, during our honeymoon to New York, we so fortunately booked dinner at the Club A Steakhouse. I’ll definitely struggle to happily eat steak back in the UK knowing there will always be better steak across the pond at the Club A Steakhouse.  What made it perfect was the staff were lovely, the decor is so classy and warming, and they had a string instrument band playing the best music to suit the atmosphere.  It’s just a shame I can’t give them a 6th star!!"
116,went there twice for my husbands promotion and my birthday. the owner is sweet he always takes a photo of you on your special occasion and he signs it for you to take it home. food and steak is absolutely delicious. staff is kind as well.
117,The food is delicious obviously but the service and care for the customer is second to none. I went here 7 years ago and returned with my kids tonight and they absolutely loved it. My favourite restaurant in NYC without doubt.
118,"This restaurant is ranked no 1 of all NYC restaurants in Tripadvisor, and for a reason. They know it and work hard for it, and there is nothing wrong with that. Food was excellent and service good. The owners walked around checking that everything was OK, and asked if we where there for any special occasion. We told him we had an anniversary, and a bit later a waitress came to ask if she could take a picture, and still a bit later we got a surprise dessert, and the owner, Bruno, came to present a congratulation card with the picture. And yes, they do it for everyone with an occasion, and yes, it is clever marketing, but done in a very nice way and leaving a good memory."
119,"My daughter booked this restaurant for 8 of us to go there after renewing her wedding vows in NYC. She had been before and said the service and food was excellent, and she is not wrong. Due to circumstances we arrived at the restaurant an hour early, 6pm, but no problem we sat at the bar and the barman made us feel very welcome, got us drinks and chatted to us. The owner Bruno came over, told us he was getting the table ready and that we could sit down very shortly, he then spent time with us chatting.  The decor inside is very nice with lots of Black & White pictures, of celebrities, families etc with owner Bruno in a lot of them, and everybody with a happy smile on their faces.  The table was ready in about 15 minutes and we sat down and ordered food, the waiters were like ballet dancers, moving around the table, placing bread, cutlery etc without any fuss and us not really noticing what was being done, it was great.  When the food arrived it was as my daughter had said, great, I think we all different cuts of meat but all steaks were cooked to perfection and plenty of it, accompanied by plenty of side dishes. All 8 of us we very happy and fully fed by the end of the main course.  We then got a surprise shot of limoncello, and then a small desert each, which also was unexpected but very nice, and again very pleasant and attentive waiters.  As we were sitting around the table waiting for our meals the young lady at front of house came over and took our picture, and we assumed to put into there album as my daughter was still in her wedding dress, but no, at the end, when we were paying our bill she came over and gave each couple a print out each in a little paper frame, what an excellent touch to end an excellent experience. This is why they are and should be number 1 in New York.  To be honest, compared to the UK, this was the dearest steak I have ever had, but probably the best, and with all the extra little touches and the great service I would say it is well worth the money for this experience, especially in NYC.  Thank you Bruno and all the team for making our special day, special."
120,"Visited for NY for my birthday and picked out this restaurant based on reviews. It was fantastic! The food, ambiance and service was first class; even the owner personally visited all tables to chat to everyone such a lovely touch. The staff made us feel very welcome and provided 3 deserts on a plate with compliments for my birthday. They even took a photo of us all and presented it to us at the end of the meal such a lovely thing to do."
121,"It is one of the best restaurants that I have visited in a long time, The food is super delicious and the staff is very friendly and they serve you very well, The dessert is very good, We liked visiting that place, we will return."
122,"My wife and I once again enjoyed our steak dinners at Club A, this time accompanied by our daughter and granddaughter. They were lavish in their praise of the dinner. In addition, the owner was overwhelmingly gracious and once he learned our New York trip was celebrating our granddaughter’s birthday, he gifted her/us a complementary three selection dessert, big enough for us all to share. There is a reason this restaurant retains its top Trip Advisor rating and I recommend it without reservation."
123,"Steak was absolutely delicious here and great portion size too. Staff were really friendly as soon as we walked in and showed us to our table even though we were half an hour early for our reservation.  We also had our picture taken and a signed card from the owner to take home as a memento along with a generous complimentary dessert too.  Loved the food, wine and atmosphere here and very deserving of the no.1 NY spot on tripadvisor!"
124,"I found this steakhouse on Trip Advisor and after reading a lot of great reviews I thought I would give it a shot. It was my wife’s birthday. We had a party of 5. Making a reservation was easy on Open Table. Our table was ready when we got there. We were seated in the main dining room on the first floor. My wife went upstairs to use the restroom just after we got there and thought the second floor dining room was much nicer and asked to be moved. They happily complied.  The server was excellent. Very prompt with enough attention but without being too intrusive. They had a nice wine list. I really detest the outrageous markup on wine in most restaurants. Although high I thought the prices for most of their wines were fair given this is a NYC upper east side steakhouse.  The food was excellent. Steaks were cooked perfectly as well as sides. I was surprised sautéed mushrooms were not on the menu which I usually order with my steak. Asparagus and baked potato were very good. We did get a really tasty mushroom ravioli each prior to the meal on the house.  My wife was not shy about letting the server know it was her birthday. After dinner the server brought out a tray not with one small piece of cake but a piece of cheesecake, a piece of tiramisu and several chocolate mousse and several cream puffs. Unbelievable!  The owner was very present making sure we were happy and well taken care of. After the meal one of the servers took a group picture and printed it and placed it in a card they have designed for this purpose wishing her a happy birthday and thanking us for dining with them.  It is unusual to find a place with excellent food, not outrageous prices and an owner and staff that really seem to care that we were there and to give us a great experience. Club A did all of this and more. I would highly recommend Club A when in NYC."
125,It was 10 years since my wife and I last visited Club A. It was the right place to share our wedding anniversary celebration bringing back wonderful memories with our daughter. The restaurant certainly didn’t disappoint. Best New York Strip in town and excellent service. We will visit again next time in New York. David & Samantha -(England )
126,"I appreciate everything, food, service and atmosphere. i will come back next time i vitis new york!!"
127,I’m very surprised that his is the no.1 restaurant in NYC. Service was exceptional but we found the food and drink to be average. We were not a fan of the bacon app or the Mac and cheese. We’ve had better steak at average restaurants. Dessert was great!
128,The food and service here are exemplary! This was the 2nd time we have visited. My wife hasn’t eaten steak since the first time 3 years ago. We went this time for her 50th birthday. The staff couldn’t do enough to ensure that she had a good night!
129,"Just celebrated my birthday there, and always blown away by the service level ! The food was just amazing but the service stole the show … we simply asked about a dish that was not in the menu and within 20 min. We got a small complementary taste without anyone doing any fuss about it… at all time the right amount at attentiveness, and once again… the NY steak was AMAZING !!!"
130,Wow! Such lovely hospitality from the waiter through to the owner. Food was delicious and dessert scrumptious. The ravioli amuse-bouche was a taste exploding surprise.
131,"Club A was awesome!!!!! Service was awesome, the owner was welcoming and very nice, when on a trip with grandparents and this was my favorite!!! Food was great and would love to go there again. Definitely recommend if going to NYC, great way to end the trip."
132,"Not a good experience despite all the rave reviews. Steak was fair quality, meals were nothing to be excited about, service was good but not exceptional and overall we would not return"
133,"If you’re looking for a special restaurant that cares about your dining experience and goes that extra mile, you won’t be disappointed at club A Steakhouse. Between the beautiful ambiance with soft, live music and the charming decor, extremely attentive waitstaff and owner, and top quality food and beverage-our meal was a night that we will always remember."
134,Wonderful and authentic experience! Excellent service and a perfect surprise at the end of our meal! Will not spoil it but trust me it is worth to join the A club!
135,"While traveling from Miami 2 years ago, we came across Club A. Needless to say, after the pandemic, our first restaurant back to NYC was Club A. The owner Bruno does not take a back seat. He is constantly walking around ensuring his guests feel at home. The quality of the food and service is 5 star. A must do when in NYC. You will not be disappointed!!!!!"
136,Our family had dinner here (kids ages 9 & 12) and everything was absolutely amazing. We were visiting NYC for the week and celebrated my birthday and our anniversary. The service and the food were fantastic. It was definitely a highlight of our trip and quite possibly my favorite thing about the trip. Highly recommend!
137,"We were looking for a nice steackhouse restaurant, we were not disapointed. The meat is absolutely amazing and the service is 5*."
138,"Without a doubt, always the best meal and service in New York City. We cannot visit the city without a visit to this wonderful restaurant. You will not be disappointed!"
139,The food and service was remarkable. Every bite was memorable. Highly recommended. Can’t wait to return sometime in the near future.
140,"Club A Steakhouse is definitely a must visit restaurant when in New York. The Ambiance, decor and food were spectacular. We shared the Porterhouse for 2, Salmon Tartar, creamed spinach and the Mac and cheese. I can't say enough good things about the food. Everything was perfect! A nice added touch was having the owner greet us and give us a signed picture they took of us. The client experience is top notch and this was the best restaurant we visited in our 4 day trip to New York."
141,"Deserving of being number 1 on Trip Advisor!! This restaurant was fabulous from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Service and food were amazing, you felt totally taken care of and I felt very special on my birthday! We will absolutely return on our next visit to New York Thank you for such a wonderful experience"
142,"Fabulous food, fabulous friendly service, fabulous wine, and a free selection of desserts!! Amazing. Bruno the owner took our picture as a keepsake for us, a lovely touch(not done anywhere else during our trip). Many thanks to all front and back of house staff 💞"
143,"Arrived at the restaurant after a pretty last minute booking. Beautiful decor and a great atmosphere. Food and service were exceptional. Additionally, we got a free celebratory dessert for our daughters 21st birthday. Very impressed. The best steak I have ever eaten."
144,"Great ambience , wonderful service and amazing food. Highly recommend this restaurant as the staff go that extra mile. It was our anniversary and the staff couldn’t have treated us better."
145,"Excellent dinner, excellent service, great atmosphere. We loved it. My husband's steak was perfect. My seafood cocktail had wonderful large lump crabmeat, delicious lobster and shrimp, and yummy sauces. The owner and staff were so nice. We will definitely return!"
146,Great experience with excellent meat and superior management Enjoyed the picture Had a very pleasant evening Great place
147,"Club A was sensational. Amazing food and awesome service. Would highly recommend !! Many thanks guys for your fabulous service, really appreciate it !"
148,Family owned—does NOT disappoint! Fabulous menu—incredible staff—our favorite part is we get to see the owner every time we are there. If you want a special place to enjoy an incredible meal—with an amazing atmosphere -put this place on your calendar! You will be glad you did and will become a repeat customer like us!
149,"This restaurant is AMAZING! We had a rehearsal dinner for 20 people on May 23 for my family and the grooms family. It was perfect. The food was excellent, the staff was excellent, and the room was excellent. They have a private room in the wine cellar and it was perfect for our group. The owner Bruno made sure everyone was happy. They even took a group photo and printed it out for us to keep. I can’t say enough good things about this place."
150,"We were in the city for a family wedding. I was the one assigned to pick a place for dinner for 12 of us. I called several places and finally found Club A. What a great time we had dining at this restaurant. We were lucky to be seated downstairs in the wine cellar.  Our server and all of our dinners were wonderful. I had the sea bass and it was cooked perfectly , my husband ordered the filet mignon and he said it was perfect.  The owner, Bruno stopped over to check on us and when he heard we were celebrating something special he provided us with several delicious desserts.  Definitely will be back next time in the city."
151,"We had a wonderful experience at Club A from start to finish. We were welcomed upon our arrival and seated for our reservation right away. We were served water and a wine list immediately while we perused the menu. My husband asked for some options and the server was very helpful. The owner came by to say hello. The wait for our appetizers was brief and they were delicious. My husband had the crab cake and I had the beet salad. When our steaks and sides arrived they were cooked to perfection and the flavor was fantastic. The restaurant offers sauces, but my filet was perfect, as is. The owner stopped back by between the main course and dessert and asked what brought us in. We shared that we had traveled from Florida and he thanked us for dining with them. The hostess came by a few minutes later and asked to take our photo, which the owner then presented to us (printed) in a nice little folder with a note from him. It was a nice touch and a great memory. We will certainly be back when visiting NYC. We 10/10 recommend this establishment."
152,"What a truly wonderful evening! Everything was perfect - friendly knowledgeable hosts, fabulous decor and ambiance and absolutely delicious food! We had an enjoyable memorable family evening and will most definitely return!"
153,"Visited with my wife on our honeymoon in New York. The food, wine and service was exceptional, we both had the NY strip steak and couldn’t fault the quality of the meat, the way it was cooked and how well seasoned it was. The owner Bruno came and checked up on us whilst we dined and then we were given a lovely desert platter on the house as a congratulations for our special occasion. All the staff were very pleasant and attentive. Only criticism was that the cocktails we ordered at the end of our meal were watery and tasteless, but after mentioning this to the staff they took them off the bill and gave us some limoncello to apologise which they really didn’t have to do. Overall would highly recommend if you are looking for a great quality steak at a family-run restaurant."
154,"What can I say about our dinner experience. My wife and I were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and I wanted it to be special. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a very friendly and professional staff. Our table was very convenient and were served by extremely nice wait staff. The wine was terrific, the food (salmon for my wife and a steak for myself) was exceptional, and the timing couldn’t have been better. In celebration of our anniversary, the waiter brought out a plate of complimentary dessert with “Happy Anniversary” written on the perimeter. Everything was delicious and we were fortunate enough to meet the owner’s son who was very nice welcoming us to the restaurant and congratulating us on our anniversary. I conveyed our pleasure with our visit and hope to visit again. He even assisted us in hailing a cab for our trip downtown in time for our theater stay. Definitely a great place for dinner."
155,"I had the privilege of eating at Club A tonight with 5 best friends. What a wonderful place! The ambience was so NYC, the service above and beyond, the food absolutely amazing. The owner was there this evening and gave our unique dining experience a personal touch. We felt like celebrities! I often order a $200 filet mignon from one of the world's best steakhouses. Club A's filet mignon was cooked to perfection and absolutely competed with the world's finest. I will be back! What a treat for an out-of-towner! Highly recommended."
156,"Great dining experience, waiter’s very friendly and take good attention on what they are doing. The Owner came to our table, took care of our desert, even took a picture and dedicated to us. The food great. Carlos and Marguerite"
157,"Excellent service, excellent food, excellent atmosphere. Definitely will return next time we visit NYC. Personal touches to service were exceptional. Everything was cooked to perfection and had wonderful flavor."
158,"The whole experience was amazing, the service was just remarkable and speedy. I went for my birthday and my friend told the hostess and they brought our dessert with a candle , and took a picture and printed it out for us free of charge. I would recommend this restaurant."
159,"We came to Club A during Restaurant Week and weren’t disappointed. Upon on entering the restaurant we were granted by tasteful background music and were shown upstairs to our table.  I started with the thick bacon and my husband the Caesar salad, both excellent. For main course I had to have the steak which was cooked to perfection and I chose a side of delicious Mac and cheese. My husband had salmon with a sensational crumb served with fries.  To finish off our meal we shared a tiramisu and profiteroles.  The service was excellent and it was a special trip to the number 1 restaurant in New York."
160,"Amazing steak house with top notch service. Food is outstanding, steak was cooked perfectly. Family owned and it shows. Great personal touch to our anniversary. I will not ruin the surprise! But I will be back."
161,"So I was looking for an Old school steak place in the city for our final night visiting NY. There are of course many options to chose from but I got a good vibe from the reviews I read on Club A Steakhouse so we decided to try it. Boy what a fantastic decision!!! From the moment we walked into the restaurant to the moment we left, we were attended to by the wait staff for anything we needed. We had reservations for 7pm on a Tuesday and were immediately seated. Within a minute we had an assortment of bread on our table and put in an order for bottled still water. We skipped appetizers as we were full from lunch but ordered a couple classes of a nice Pinot Noir and some Lemonade for our son. My wife and I are suckers for a great steak but when we saw the fish options decided on the Chilean Sea Bass and Branzino. My son however reminded us why we were there and chose the Filet Mignon. Now, we have frequented Ruth Chris, Flemings, Boa, Musso and Franks etc so we have had a good steak before. Our son let us try his Filet (not be choice-- parenting over-ride) and it was cooked to perfection. The Sea Bass and Branzino were also perfectly cooked. For sides we did the whipped potatoes (aka mashed potatoes), creamed spinach, steamed broccoli and mac and cheese. All were great. Our wine glasses were never empty and despite how hard my son tried he could not finish his lemonade before it was filled again. At the end of the night the owner personally thanked my for dining their as we left. Club A Steakhouse is right up there with the best of them in offering fine dining cuisine. My hats off to you guys-- keep doing what your doing!!!"
162,We came here from London as 2 couples on our anniversary. We had such an amazing experience. The food was amazing; such great service & lovely little touches. Highly recommend
163,"An absolutely phonemenal experiance at club A, Iggy was an amazing server and host. I would highly recommend this location for a romantic night in NYC."
164,"First time to the restaurant, so I didn’t know what to expect. The restaurant in pictures doesn’t give it justice. It’s really beautiful inside. The service and food was perfect and the steaks were delicious! We were celebrating our anniversary. They gave a photo of us and personally met the owner. The city can be cold and overwhelming. This restaurant makes you feel at home. Thanks so much."
165,"First time at Club A and had a wonderful experience. Service was exceptional, food was fantastic, and Bruno, the owner, was friendly, attentive, and made sure every detail was on point. He is clearly committed to providing great service with a personal touch. Highly recommended."
166,"I hardly give anyone 5 stars but I’m never disappointed when I come here. The service, the food, and the manager Bruno are amazing. Great atmosphere for a date, a birthday or just simply because you’re hungry! Try and be blown away"
167,"I came here on a date with my girlfriend a few months ago, and have been meaning to write a review for a while. Club A had absolutely stellar food, a lovely atmosphere, and very kind staff. On top of the delicious food, we went there to celebrate a special occasion, and the staff was kind enough to take a complimentary photograph of us and print it for us with a hand-signed 'thank you' message from the owner, Bruno Selimaj (this is still up on our fridge!). I had a really great experience at Club A and will certainly return for future special occasions."
168,"Nice service, they were really welcoming. Good food and nice environment……………. The locais pretty good too. ……………….,,"
169,Wonderful food and service. The servers are extremely attentive and helpful. Felt like I’m definitely going to come back again. Thank you for your hospitality.
170,"Just had a few days in New York and as we visited here a few years ago, we wanted to dine here again. The first visit was just my wife and I, this time we went with my brother and his wife as we told them they will not have a steak anywhere better than Club A. The whole dining experience is absolutely first class, from being greeted and throughout the whole evening. The service is spot on, the food is perfection. If you want a memorable evening dining out, this is the only place to go. We couldn’t recommend this restaurant highly enough. In a word “Perfect “"
171,"Everything was excellent from the moment we made the reservation! Great food, staff, and ambiance with nice Jazz music. I agree with other reviewers…Bruno the owner makes a difference! He is very attentive and service oriented. Our friends were celebrating their wedding anniversary, the waiter took a photo, and Bruno gave it to them as a present!!! I loved this special detail! Great finding in NYC, definitively will go back when returning to NY. Highly recommended."
172,"They say: True Love is Rare- like a good steak!! Indeed, this is our the best steakhouse in NYC!! This is our regular stop for my family and I! From food, to service, we have never left the place unhappy! Will be back this weekend!! ❤️"
173,"Out of this world. From the moment we walked into the restaurant, we were made to feel so welcome. We were greeted by the owner (Bruno) who asked if it was our first time. When we said yes, he offered us the best table in the house and took us upstairs to a lovely corner window seat . The service from start to finish was impeccable, the food was out of this world. We were celebrating our engagement and we were given a souvenir photograph and a complimentary trio of desserts which were each more delicious than the last. We can’t wait to come again. Thank you Bruno and team - you deserve the number one spot wholeheartedly!"
174,"We love this place, the ambiance, the food, and the impeccable service. We were here for Valentine's Day and then wanted to celebrate my birthday somewhere special, and even though we live in central NJ - l and a bit of a hike to get here, I knew this was the perfect place! We even got our picture taken by the restaurant, and the owner came over to sign it. It’s the same owner for 44 years - he knows how to make you feel special, even when it’s not your birthday. I highly recommend trying this restaurant."
175,"We have had dinner tonight at this amazing steak house, and I cannot wait to wright a review.  At fisrt, the place sends a message of being vibrant and cosy, with musiciens playing soft jazz and blues. As our experience started, service was precise and extremely attentive; the waiter was caring without excess but in a very simple and polite manner. Nothing different to expect from a restaurant one could say, however, experiences in NYC have not always showed the same. The quality of our dinner has been outstanding: we shared a starter - a crab cake- was extremely fresh and generous. The entree - a porterhouse for two- was perfectly served, at the right temperature, which is not easy when requesting beef to be bleu! Throughout our dinner, the presence and the eye of the owner - Mr Bruno Selimaj - never stopped being there, himself taking personal care of all guests well-being.  This is our seventh trip to NYC, without having being able to travel here in the past two years because of COVID, but Club A is an address we will keep in our minds for our next visit: a restaurant you must experience!"
176,An amazing night from start to finish. Food was perfectly cooked and all staff including Bruno were very professional! Pulled out all the stops for my Partner’s 30th birthday.
177,I had been Club A several years prior on a family trip and was hoping that it would be as memorable for my girlfriend getaway. Club A did not disappoint. We had the fried calamari appetizer which was crispy and tender. Three of us ordered the filet and one had the bone in strip. The flavor and tenderness of the steaks was hands down the best we have ever had. Our service was fabulous also. And at the end we were treated with a dessert sampling welcoming us all back to NYC.
178,"We were excited to come back to Club A. We had been here a few years ago and remembered it as the best steak we had ever had. We were in NYC for a weekend over my husband’s birthday! I booked a table immediately on Open Table. I mentioned in the reservation that we were celebrating his birthday. We (family of 4, with 2 kids 8&10) were given a beautiful table, with a window view. Dinner was extraordinary. Calamari app was delicious. Steaks were cooked to perfection and sides were very generous. On top of a great meal, I felt like we (along with all the other patrons) were Bruno’s personal guests. Bruno, the owner, welcomed us on check in and made the rounds checking on each table several times throughout the evening. My children were treated with the utmost respect. And Since we were there for a special occasion, they brought us an extra treat before our steak and took our picture after dinner. Bruno brought the picture with a note thanking us for celebrating there. Clearly a 5 star dining experience! Highly recommend to anyone!"
179,"Food was very good, service was prompt and the owner, Bruno, went out of his way to make us feel welcomed in his restaurant. Definitely would return. Highly recommended."
180,"Excellent experience at Club A. The food was outstanding and the service was brilliant. Steaks were cooked perfectly, would definitely return!"
181,"We dined here during the New York Restaurant Week over valentines. There was a special menu which offered unbelievable value for money. The food was perfectly cooked and the portion sizes were ideal. As a departing gift, we were presented with a couples photo of us taken after the meal with a personalised note (photo taken with our permission, of course!) Excellent food, service and atmosphere. 10/10."
182,The quality of food and service is always amazing Great live music and very cozy atmosphere. We have an upcoming reservation for Valentine’s Day and we cannot wait to go back See you soon CLUB A ❤️
183,Went to New York in December and when planning our meals we saw that this place had excellent reviews. It certainly didn't disappoint. The food was so good and such great value for money we came back again a few night later!
184,"This is one of the BEST steakhouses in NY. We ordered the crab cakes and oysters for appetizers and filet mignon for our meal . ALL were cooked to perfection . Lovely jazz duo played throughout the evening . Bruno , the owner is a charming gentleman who made a point of stopping at our table to ensure all was well with our meals . The desserts are wonderful and terrific wine and drink selection ! The wait staff was fabulous and very attentive to us throughout the evening . The decor had an old world elegance !! Perfect evening . Can’t wait to come back !"
185,"We took a girls trip to NYC , took in a show and needed a special place to go to dinner. A iconic steak house seemed to be the best choice. Looking at different reviews and the location of our hotel we settled on Club A which was an 8 minute walk for us. This was one of the best meals the four of us had ever had in the city. The atmosphere was gorgeous, the service impeccable the food phenomenal the table visits by Bruno the owner delightful and the music enjoyable. From start to finish we were treated like royalty and we appreciated all the extras that were bestowed upon us. If your looking for a classic piece of New York with live music and exquisite food and atmosphere look no further than Club A. Everything was fantastic from appetizer to dessert. We will be back. Thank you Bruno and staff."
186,"We originally came here back in November 2019 for dinner on the night that we got engaged in Central Park and it was fantastic. Two years later, we returned to NYC to get married in Central Park and chose Club A Steakhouse for the location of our wedding dinner (just the two of us). What sets this place apart from other (beyond the food) is the unbelievable customer service. They went above and beyond to ensure that our night was as special as possible. I've never been to a restaraunt where the owner (Bruno) comes around to each table during the meal to ensure that everything is okay. At the end of the evening, they took a photo of us with our wedding cake, then printed out a copy of the photo and brough it back out to us with a personalized note signed by the owner. It's these small things that made such a memorable experience for us and the reason we will return again the next time we are in NYC. It is never very busy and you don't feel rushed to leave and can enjoy your meal. Our server (who was also our server two years ago) was also excellent. Very professional yet personable as well (unfortunately I don't remember his name)."
187,"Tasty food, staff made the occasion special! Tables sufficiently separated. We forgot about this neighborhood restaurant, will return."
188,I can completely see why this is number 1 on trip advisor. This was a 10/10 experience. Firstly the steaks were out of this world and cooked to perfection. The owner whom Was on hand and super attentive made the experience much more personal. It was my birthday meal and oh my they made a complete fuss of me (unlike other places we’d booked and been to in NYC) this meal was so memorable and I can not recommend it enough. Thank you thank you to everyone at club a steakhouse !!! We will be back ❤️
189,The ribeye was absolutely delicious. I will be back to try many more dishes. Highly recommend this place!
190,"I had the chance to celebrate my birthday at Club A Steakhouse and it was amazing! Since it was my birthday they put me on the second floor in front of the window. The view was beautiful, the service was great, and the food phenomenal! I had a Prime Rib eye with an assortment of sides. One of the best steaks I've had. At the end they brought my a slice of cake and took a photo of my and my guest. When we finished they handed me the photo printed. It made the night even more special! I would definitely go back!"
191,"It was our first time at Club A Steakhouse. Kudos to the Chef! My steak was cooked perfectly, my husbands branzino was excellent. Our waiter was super attentive, the manager walked around the restaurant asking customers about their dinner. We informed the manager that everything was fabulous!! The restaurants motto is that the customer is the most important visitor on this premises and they treat you that way. We can't wait to go back!"
192,"We arrived at Club A and were immediately greeted by the host who immediately congratulated us on our third child. After being seated our server suggested the dry aged porterhouse for two. It was the most delicious steak I have ever eaten in my life. The servers were constantly attentive. One of the owner’s sons came to check on us during the meal and also mentioned our child’s birth. During the meal, they asked to take a picture of us and provided us with an amazing dessert. Overall, it was an A+ experience and one of the best we have ever had in a restaurant regardless of location. We will definitely be back!"
193,Back in the city after too long and looking for a special night. Club A didn’t disappoint! Great service and perfect steak. My wife had a wonderful salmon. It’s a can’t miss evening!
194,"I am really really disappointed in trip advisor rating this as number 1 restaurant in New York. My wife and I went there because of this rating. Nothing was better than fair. Food below average. Table selection below average. Service average. Atmosphere average. Wife and I expected to be blown away but didn’t happen. We both ordered 10 oz filet and got butt cut pieces of the filet. For $55, it should have been center cut. Probably the most disappointed I have ever been in a restaurant. Don’t make our mistake."
195,"Just simply a brilliant experience from start to finish! Service is impeccable and the food just wonderful, we shared the porterhouse and it was fantastic. If you’re looking for a traditional family run steakhouse then look no further. I can see why this is the number 1 in New York!"
196,"Has literally the best steak I’ve ever had in my life here last night. All the staff were amazing, they even took a picture of us which the owner hand signed. Couldn’t possibly recommend more"
197,"Love the ambiance at Club A and Mr Bruno in perticular. We revisited after years and love the very good steak, excellent wine, experienced staff but also the setting and background music. Really would wish it was closer to home."
198,"The owner is SO kind and welcoming, the food is superb and the staff outstanding. We told the owner if we were ever back in NYC we would absolutely return and 7 years later we made it . He graciously gave us a complimentary dessert with “welcome back” written in chocolate on the plate! Very much appreciated! Highly recommend!"
199,"Wow! Did I have a great birthday! We live in Queens & love coming into the city for special occasions but haven't in about 2 years due to Covid-19. My husband decided the time was right and looked for somewhere new & special for my Birthday dinner. Not only does Club A get 5 stars but so does my husband. This place is amazing from the moment you enter 'til the moment you leave. The staff, the service and of course the food. The owner, Bruno, welcomed us & gave us a little history on the restaurant, passing by every once in a while to be sure all was good. Starting with a cocktail, shared the crab cake appetizer which was awesome, treated to a spinach & mushrooom stuffed ravioli covered with a mushroom cream sauce that was unbelievably good. The steaks are large for 2 seniors & there was no problem with us sharing the NY Strip steak. Served to us sliced along with asparagus we were sharing it was perfect! And what's a birthday without blowing out a candle on a complimentary piece of cheesecake? Have already recommended to friends, and we'll be visiting again. Thanks to all for my special day!"
200,"The best steak I have ever eaten, period! The filet is 10 oz and was so tender and flavorful that I was in steak heaven. The Club A is a dining experience that you have to try if you are in the mood for a steak. The staff will treat you like family and Bruno the owner will come by your table to chat and check to make sure everything is to your liking. This is the second time I have eaten there and both times did not disappoint. I highly recommend this steak house as you will truly have a magical experience."
201,"We went to Club A to celebrate my birthday, and they made us feel so special and catered to our every need. It was a great atmosphere and the food was amazing. They took a picture and Bruno personally signed the card it came in. I received a beautiful dessert that was on the house for my birthday, and after our dinner we were offered a complimentary cocktail at the bar. We will definitely come back here, they went above and beyond our expectations!"
202,"Club A Steakhouse was such a treat tonight! We had looked up the Best Steakhouse in NYC and figured it might be difficult to get a reservation. We saw Aladdin at 2pm and our reservation was at 5:30pm. We walked 40 minutes from our favorite Hotel Casablanca and it was the Best meal and steaks any of us have had in quite a while! The service was great and Chef’s treat of a special mushroom ravioli part way thru the meal and what a way to finish with a trio of Tirimisu/ Cream Puffs/ Cheesecake!  My friend was correct- the Best Steakhouse in NYC!  Bruno runs an Amazing restaurant and our little Doorman Trim was a delightful gentleman! What an exquisite experience and meal and all of us will plan to come here again when we return to NYC!  Marc  Johnson City, TN"
203,"Without a doubt, the best restaurant in NYC. And there are several reasons that for 57 years it has been successful. As stated on the back of their menu;  “A customer is the most important visitor on our premises. They are not dependent on us. We are dependent on them. They are not an interruption of our work. They are the purpose of it. They are not an outsider of our business. They are part of it. We are not doing them a favor by serving them. They are doing us a favor by giving us the opportunity to do so.”"
204,"Wonderful steakhouse. Our waiter was Jake. He said from State Farm but we didn’t believe him—haha—very nice guy. Chilean sea bass, steaks, asparagus—everything was outstanding. They accommodated us more than we could ask for including helping with our mother’s wheelchair. Desserts were outstanding. Definitely will return."
205,I went to this restaurant in 2019 for my 50th birthday in NYC after doing the Rocky steps on Philly. Back again for my wifes 50th after a Covid cancellation. This is the best restaurant ive ever been to. The owner and his Sons are professional and so committed to the experience of a top class establishment. You have to dine here if your ever in NYC. Craig & Family from Newcastle (Toon) England
206,Everything was cooked to perfection and the service was incredible from everyone involved in the restaurant. Highly Recommended.
207,"Based on #1 out of 8900 restaurants by TripAdvisor for NYC, we had a high expectations by reserving a table during our recent visit. When we arrived at 7 pm on time for our reserved time, the restaurant was cleaning up after a small banquet. We got to our table about 20 minutes later by an unfriendly hostess. While we were waiting, we sat at the bar and wanted a drink. The bartender said, he wasn't filling any drinks at the bar because he was busy filling orders from dinner customers. I have never had that experience. Appetizers were decent but average. The steak took too long to come out with the sides and the steak was lukewarm like it was sitting around after cooking for about 20 minutes. Multiple people came by to ask what we wanted but it usually took about 3rd waiter to get something like Tabasco sauce. I go to steakhouses all the time and this was absolutely the worse experience. I am not sure what other travelers saw when they collectively gave it a top restaurant in NYC."
208,We read the reviews and bought the Groupon to use for our NYC visit. The decor is lovely here. The service is smooth and quiet. Not at all like the hustle and bustle of the big name steak places. We were offered our choice of wine bottles between cab Sauvignon and Pinot Grigio. The cab was quite good. Overall the food was good but the service and experience was the real star. They did a wonderful job with a surprise dessert for my girlfriend and that was the greatest thing of the whole meal. They also take a lovely photo of you and it's presented to you when you leave in a little folder. The Groupon is a great value if you eat moderately. For the big appetite you may need to add some more things.
209,"We visited the city to meet up with some family members and wanted a nice steakhouse to celebrate our reunion. This place did not disappoint. The food and service was excellent. The owner Bruno stopped by our table to check in and talk to us. He gave us the history of the restaurant and made us feel so welcome and appreciated for visiting. He even sent over some dessert and pasta on the house. We LOVED this place and plan to visit each and every time we come back to the city. It’s not often you have an experience as amazing as this at a busy, popular restaurant."
210,"What a wonderful dining experience from start to finish!! The ambiance was classy, the environment was friendly and the staff made us feel like family! The food was second to none and the owner rounded frequently to make sure that all of our needs were met. “Njishi” means “the first” or “the best” in Albanian. After spending a couple years in Albania, we truly can say that A Club Steakhouse represents all of the amazing attributes of the Albanian culture! Thank you and we highly recommend your restaurant!"
211,Had a meal here with a friend. We had a couple of appetizers that were ok. My steak was a little over cooked (more medium than medium rare) and tougher than I would have expected. It was edible but not the level you expect for this sort of rating. The fries were a little cold  Overall I really was not impressed. I have eaten here a few times before and it was excellent. This time it did not stand out enough. Overall I was disappointed.  I still loved the dessert selection though.
212,"Fantastic food and even better service. Can’t recommend highly enough. The steak was cooked to perfection and the owner personally visits each table to check you are having a nice time. They even took a photo and printed it out for us and gave us complimentary drinks and dessert as it was a special occasion. Lovely atmosphere as well, will definitely return next time we are in NYC"
213,"Excellent, cozy, tasty, and friendly. Food was great, the staff was as friendly and attentive, and they check your ID and vaccination card upon entry. Desserts are out of this world world!"
214,We had a meal here during Thanksgiving. Staff were very pleasant and attentive. Food was superb and my fillet steak was cooked perfectly. All food was very tasty and beautifully served. This is the best steak I have had in NYC. Would highly recommend. We will be back on our next trip
215,"The porterhouse for two was amazing, great salad wonderful treats like mushroom ravioli and dessert place and greeting by owner along with photo! Great all around"
216,"Great ambiance, amazing food and excellent service. I always feel welcome coming here and Bruno does a great job at making sure you have a fantastic experience. They really go above and beyond. If you plan on going out to dinner for a date this is the perfect place. The setting is very romantic and is sure to impress. Also definitely order the thick cut bacon as an appetizer it is my favorite!"
217,"Can't believe the last time we came here was such a long time ago. 10 years later, this place is still amazing! The ambiance is fancy and romantic! This is the place to come for all your special occasions.. whether it's your birthday, romantic dinner, anniversary or what not, the owner, Bruno, will make it special for you. Me and hubby came for our anniversary, and we had a great time!  The NY strip steak was cooked perfectly even at well done! It was still juicy and had a nice charcoal crunch outside. It came with their home made steak sauce and that was delicious! I had some of hubby's salmon and that was very good as well. Their creamed spinach was one of the best I've had! So creamy and good.  Bruno came over and took a picture of me and hubby and printed it out for us. I thought that was such a nice gesture.  Overall, we will definitely be back here again! Highly recommended"
218,What a wonderful experience! The porterhouse steak was delicious and the service was amazing. It made us feel very special. Thx so much Bruno & staff!
219,I made a proposal at this shop. The food was very good and the staff was great. The shop and atmosphere are very good and I will go there again. Thank you for a wonderful time.
220,"We brought our two grand daughters to NYC for the day. We visited the Empire State Building for a VIP Tour, then Fox Square and Rockefeller Center to see the trees and decorations. Our final stop was Club A Steakhouse for dinner. We were welcomed by Bruno who wowed our grand daughters with our table by all the beautiful lights. We had an enjoyable and delicious evening with our top notch waiter and visits from Bruno to make sure everything was fine. Our grand daughters loved Club A! We will be back."
221,"My wife and I recently dined at Club A steakhouse to celebrate our anniversary. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation so we had a chance to hang out by the bar and enjoy the warm fire they have going in the entry area as well as the amazing decorations for the Christmas season. My wife and I both loved the atmosphere!  Once we were seated the meal exceeded all expectations. Both of our steaks (we each had the filet) were cooked and seasoned perfectly. We had Mac and cheese and roasted asparagus for the sides which were also delicious, especially the Mac and cheese! I highly recommend it for a side of you like good Mac and cheese!  After our meal was finished we were treated to a special complimentary dessert plate displaying a happy anniversary message drizzled in chocolate sauce. The cheesecake was to die for! One of the best pieces of cheesecake I’ve ever had.  They also took our photo together with the dessert and Bruno (the owner) hand delivered a postcard sized photo to us displayed with a thank you message that he personally signed himself. He was such a welcoming and friendly man and his character and charming nature resonates throughout the restaurant and staff.  Next time we visit the city we certainly won’t hesitate to visit again! The food was great but the additional friendly and welcoming touch shown by staff and owners is what really makes this place special. Thanks Bruno and staff for a special evening we won’t forget!"
222,"We had a terrific dinner. The ambience was perfect, serving staff experienced and attentive, food cooked to perfection and delicious. If you are visiting NY,NY this is the restaurant to visit. If you live in the city this should be your go to restaurant for fine steak!!! We’ll be back."
223,"The decor in the venue was awesome. Fireplace was a lovely touch. Our server, Nick, was so nice and friendly. The food was perfection. Love this place and will definitely be back. The made an effort to go around to everyone to check in. Such a nice friendly touch. Cant wait to go back."
224,"I came to Club A Steakhouse on a limb. Me and my fiancée have been going to Gallagher’s for years to celebrate birthdays but I wanted to try something new this year. This place DID NOT disappoint. The restaurant is beautifully decorated for the holidays both outside and inside. The atmosphere inside is elegant, classy, and warm, everything a good restaurant should be. Beautiful and carefully considered ambience, especially to enjoy a night out in NYC during the holiday season. We were seated and our waiter, Nick, was so attentive and warm. He was really honest about how much he thought we should order and his suggestions were perfect. There are so many generous touches that undoubtedly makes this place the best dining experience I’ve had in NYC (I’ve lived here for 25 years). They brought out complimentary ravioli which was SO GOOD (even 2/3 of us who hate ravioli licked the plate clean). They finished off the night giving us a free dessert platter and let me tell you, this dessert wasn’t just a plate of stale assorted pastries they had to get rid of. Everything on the plate was absolutely delicious, some of the best dessert I have ever had. The owner,Bruno, was so attentive and lovely. He took it upon himself to make sure everyone was having a good evening and checked in with care and warmth. All our food was delicious, steaks were cooked EXACTLY as we had asked, seared perfectly, perfect temperature, perfect seasoning. The sides were also delicious. We couldn’t believe the generosity and hospitality but I expect no less from my Albanian compatriots. Best night out we’ve had in a long time."
225,We had a wonderful meal here a week ago. It's beautifully decorated for the Holidays. We also had a Groupon certificate which they made no fuss over. In other words we did not feel ill at ease using it at all. The staff could not have been more gracious. They even have a Groupon menu they give you. The choices are excellent. The wait staff and owner are professional and friendly. It's almost an old fashioned eating experience. We also very much appreciated the noise level which is very conversation friendly unlike most (if not all) NYC places. Don't miss ordering the bacon. It's amazing. The truffle fries were good but we missed any trace of truffle on them. I had the filet which was not as good as my wife's hanger steak. I think the filet was crying out for some sauce on the side like the Hanger steak had...perhaps blue cheese. It looked a bit lonely on its plate. The desserts were good also. We also took a peek at the unstairs room which looked lovely. I am only saying that because sometimes when a restaurant seats you 'upstairs' it seems a lesser experience. This would not be so. It was totally filled up. The owner and the waiters were all very attentive and charming. You always remember when the owner comes over and asks how things are going. I am very happy they are ranked #1 on NYC Tripadvisor restaurants but it does seem a bit strange given the quality of many other places.
226,the food & service were great. we celebrate birthday & we get a picture of us with host special greeting. the steak was very good made. we loved the place & decoration.
227,"Great dining experience with my wife. Great wine list. Good Caesar salad. We both had filet and they were cooked to absolute perfection. Creamed spinach and whipped potatoes were delicious. Tiramisu, cream puffs, and cheesecake for dessert were all fantastic. The best part was Bruno and his crew treated us like we were VIPs. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Will definitely be back"
228,"Club A Steakhouse is hands-down one of the best dining experiences in the city. The food, the service, and the ambiance is amazing in this neighborhood gem. We enjoyed the best lemon drop martinis before our perfectly cooked steaks arrived. Desserts were complimentary and off-the-chain! Bruno himself was a delight and personally came to our table to ensure our experience was stellar."
229,"I went to Club A Steakhouse with my 15-year-old son during his Thanksgiving break from his boarding school in Connecticut. I travelled from Tokyo to spend time with him and wanted to have the best restaurant experience. I searched on Tripadiver and found this fantastic restaurant. On my precious trip to NY, I was a little disappointed by another famous steakhouse. Club A exceeded my expectation in every possible way. Best steak I ever had (Prime Porterhouse which was highly recommended by our waiter), great live jazz music, cozy ambience, and friendly staff, among other things. After finishing the steak, we were surprised by the desert plate with cheesecake, tiramisu and another delicious sweets. It was on the restaurant. They tool a picture of us by the restaurant camera and gave us a copy with a thank-you card with a signature of the manger. My son and I had a great time. We will return to Club A Steakhouse. Highly recommended."
230,Excellent service excellent food. The steak was so good. The service was great as well. We will come back got sure.
231,"OMG OMG ,where do I begin. Excellent restaurant ,food was amazing .Great atmosphere, staff were so attractive to all there customers. Bruno the owner ,came to each table to introduce himself ,while making sure the food and service was 100 %. This personal touch by him is rare these days . Thank you very much for a lovely evening which will stay with us for ever. Can't highly recommend this restaurant. Noreen party of 6 from IRELAND ."
232,"Visiting from Melbourne, Australia, family took me out for dinner! For a NYC steakhouse, Club A Steakhouse is Excellent. The service is impeccable. The meal was amazing, great ambiance in the restaurant and very good waitstaff. I will definitely be back to this elegant place with great atmosphere, food and staff, every time I'm in NYC, to experience again, one of the most pleasant dinner evenings I've ever had.  I hope Mr. Bruno and his amazing team, continue to successfully provide, countless pleasant dining experiences to all of us, for many decades to come."
233,"Went as a family of four and had an incredible experience. Had a big table on the second floor which has big windows overlooking the lighted tree outside. We had oysters, crabmeat cocktail, and some salads, followed by porterhouses which were cooked to perfection and prime quality.  This restaurant is on par with the best steakhouses in the city, a hidden gem. It has an old school vibe with red interior and multiple floors. Service was excellent and the owner Bruno was very friendly and stopped by our table multiple times to check in. Highly recommend."
234,"Best steakhouse experience of my life. From the staff to the food, A++++ Can’t wait to come back and have a great experience again"
235,First time at Club A mid-town. Great overall ambience and superb steaks! Will certainly be returning.
236,It feels so good to be back at club a steakhouse to experience the best environment And amazing food. Than you Bruno for making us feel so special all the time.
237,Bruno and his team provided my wife and I with a first class experience at Club A Steakhouse. The staff went the extra mile to ensure that we had a memorable dinner and evening celebrating her birthday. The steaks and side were prepared to perfection. We definitely will return to Club A the next time we visit New York City.
238,I fly up to NYC twice a year to visit my son in Manhattan and we take the time to have dinner here. Just love it and highly recommend it
239,"We live in Los Angeles and had dinner here 6 weeks ago...AND last night again. We love this place. Our Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Can't say enough about Bruno and his 3 sons (Arben, Agron, and Alban) as their hospitality and kindness along with great food will bring us back again and again."
240,"Absolute perfect Filet Mingnon, outstanding service and beautiful atmosphere! Coming back as soon as we can. We had the best night :)"
241,"Everything was perfect. Our salads were fresh and tasty. The filets were cooked perfectly as ordered. The Mac and cheese was cheesy, and the mashed potatoes were delicious. The servings were generous. The homeade tiramisu, and profiteroles are excellent. The servers were friendly, professional, and attentive. The owner is so kind, and makes sure everything is satisfactory. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. An added bonus on the night we were there, was his sweet, cute grandson who was helping out. This was a perfect place for our first time dining indoors since COVID. We felt totally safe and comfortable. All safety precautions are in place.  I highly recommend Club A, you will not be disappointed. ."
242,"For a NYC steakhouse, Club A Steakhouse is pretty good. The service is impeccable. The steak itself is solid, as are the typical sides. Pricing is also comparable to other steakhouses. Overall, a good experience."
243,"The meal was amazing, great ambiance in the restaurant and very good waitstaff. The experience was close to perfect and they brought out a birthday dessert for free and it was amazing. A photograph was asked to be taken of us at the table and then given to us on the way out. A great memoir to have from a great night. I highly recommend to anyone visiting the city."
244,"Love this place! Have been going to Club A for many years and it always delivers. High quality and unpretentious. We go for special occasions as well as a local night out. Steaks are absolutely top-notch, great wine list and usually a special surprise on the house. Staff and owner are always incredibly gracious and helpful. Have enjoyed some wonderful jazz on weekends - a real treat. Club A has a LOT of history and many stories to be appreciated as can be seen from all the photos on the walls. A real NY experience even for locals. We look forward to many more visits. Bravo Club A!"
245,"This restaurant from the food to the service to the hospitality is 5 stars. My husband and I visited from California and were looking for a steakhouse to celebrate on our last night in the city. This place did not disappoint. Our server was so kind to us and treated us like long time friends. We made a joke about me not drinking because I’m pregnant when he came around for our cocktail order and he went out of his way to be so accommodating! They brought us this divine mushroom ravioli to start, and my husband that hates mushrooms devoured it! Our steaks were cooked perfectly and the Mac and cheese was delicious! They even sent over a dessert platter with a congratulations on the side. The owner, general manager and entire serving staff stopped by multiple times to chat and ask us how we were doing, and it made the experience that much more personal.  If you’re looking for a locally owned non-restaurant chain steakhouse with excellent service and delicious food, this is the place! We can’t wait to come back to New York to visit."
246,"There’s a reason I come back to Club A every time I want to have the best dinner experience NYC can offer. From the decor, to the staff and of course THE FOOD! It’s impossible to find anything on their menu that doesn’t satisfy every single tastebud. I can’t recommend this place enough and do so to all my friends or family that visit New York."
247,"In my 47 years of life, no matter how expensive the restaurants I've ever been to were, I had never before received the level of high quality service and attention I received from the staff and owner at Club A Steakhouse. It was truly out of the ordinary, even for high-end fine dining.  The attention to detail they put into everything they do, from the moment the customer walks-into their establishment, explains why and how they've stayed in business for 43 years, in such a demanding city like NYC, where high expectations are the norm in the restaurant industry.  The food was nothing less than exquisite and flawless. Each and every dish was cooked to perfection. The filet mignon didn't need any additional sauce or seasoning, to exceed the very high expectations of every taste bud in my mouth.  The creamed spinach was undoubtedly, the absolute best companion for the steak, the best spinach dish I've ever had. The mac and cheese was also one of the most delicious, if not the most delicious, I've ever had. The tiramisu tasted so fresh and light, unlike any other of its kind. It was the perfect way to end an unforgettably amazing belated birthday dinner for my partner, which is not an easy person to please.  I fell in love with this rare gem of NYC. Not only for its mouth watering, high quality and delicious food, but more importantly, for its unparalleled and unique way of treating their patrons.  I will definitely be back to this elegant place with great atmosphere, food and staff, every time I'm in NYC, to experience again, one of the most pleasant dinner evenings I've ever had.  I hope Mr. Bruno and his amazing team, continue to successfully provide, countless pleasant dining experiences to all of us, for many decades to come."

We got lucky to meet the owner Bruno and what an interesting and amazing person he is! We were floored when the food came. We had the bacon appetizer, the mozzarella and tomatoes, and the royal platter. They were all mouthwatering delicious. I ordered the dry-aged Ny strip steak and it’s hands down the best steak in nyc! For dessert We had the homemade profiterole and the homemade tiramisu, they were banging!  I highly recommend coming here for a great, hospitable, meal experience."
