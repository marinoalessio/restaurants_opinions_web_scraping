162,"I was so surprised with this restaurant. Not only the food was great with amazing presentation but also the service was one of the best ones I’ve ever had. Mitra was so kind and made us feel so special, thank you so much for the lovely service!"
163,"Bayleaf is a classy looking restaurant with a high spec feel. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the food is very nice. The pricing, however, is totally unacceptable. I had tandoori prawns (3). This was 23£. No rice or naan included. The management will probably say that the price of food from their suppliers has risen and they are operating a premium place in a high rent area. There is lots of competition on the high street. They’re prices are far better. Sort out your pricing or you will have no customers left."
164,Our first time at Bayleaf and we didn’t leave disappointed. I assure you the food tastes as good as it looks. The staff especially Bodrul & Mitra went above & beyond. This place felt like home. Thank you for being very attentive. We’ll be coming back for sure☺️
