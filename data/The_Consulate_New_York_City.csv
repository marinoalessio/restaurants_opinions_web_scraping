0,The cocktails are the best in NYC. The bartenders are so nice. a MUST visit place! Me and my friends come here all the time and are never disappointed with the level of service and atmosphere. 🔥🔥🔥
1,"We had an excellent meal at The Consulate last night. The atmosphere is terrific, with a real European vibe, beautiful bar area and a comfortable dining area. Decor is great. I had the duck, served with mashed potatoes and a delicious sauce, extra heirloom veggies on the side. Fantastic! Our waitress, Staka, explained everything and was always attentive when we needed anything. Plus they have live jazz - amazing place!!"
2,"We love love loved it! All was just perfect! Beautiful people, charming atmosphere and great food and service! We can’t wait to go back"
3,"My husband and I came in for a fantastic brunch! We sat at the bar and had the grilled cheese at the recommendation of the awesome bartender George - he certainly didn’t lead us wrong! Great food and great cocktails, highly recommend!"
4,"We booked a Table for 3 via Resy prior to arriving in New York for Xmas. The Subway Journey & Walk to the Restaurant was a good distance from our Midtown Hotel & we wondered whether we'd made the right decision!!! Upon opening the door to enter we we're met with a raucous wall of noise & not only a full restaurant but also customers waiting to be accommodated. The only downside was that it appeared that the management 'might' have taken too many bookings that they were struggling to seat, nevertheless we were greeted with Champagne on the House whilst seated at the bar & apologies all round. Once seated, staff were friendly, knowledgeable & looked after us really well. The Menu offered a variety of options & we had a super evening in a really busy destination restaurant. A great evening."
5,"Bad experience. The food is normal and the service is terrible. Doesn’t match the quality service/product for the price. You are totally forgotten inside and it seems that all the waitresses are making you a favor. I just don’t recommend, specially because of this bad service."
6,Great martinis/atmosphere and great bartender George! Nice and welcoming spot on the upper west side
7,"We stumbled across this lovely cosy restaurant when holidaying in New York over Christmas Day. Loved the decor, low lighting and atmosphere. Amazed they could seat us on the spot. Food was nice."
8,"Beautiful decor, great drinks, great staff! George was a great bartender and had lovely service! This was the perfect experience for my first visit in the city. 10/10"
9,"Beautiful drinks & atmosphere, as well as wonderful holiday decor! George, the bartender, was great & super helpful!"
10,"Great location, pleasant atmosphere, delicious food … Staff are so professional and friendly … Our server Staka , great girl , helping us with menu and orders for kids. Highly recommended !"
11,Doing the classics right! This is one of the top spots in the upper west side. There aren’t a ton of cocktail bars in this area and this is highly recommended.
12,Great restaurant great vibe and great bartender! Recommend for any occasion! Can be 10am or 8pm great place for kids or just party with friends
13,"Although staying at a hotel o Times Square we used the metro very easily to travel to this restaurant for my Birthday. The food i had was great - mostly seafood - the octopus to start and clam pasta for main - both excellent. My husband was slightly disappointed by his food - too much oil on the shrimp and the bread oiled too and his wagyu burger the same - a little too much oil on everything but I guess its a personal preference. Good cocktails, ambience and service."
14,Great food and great service! Thanks Staka! Had the Frise salad and pineapple upside down cake. 10/10 would recommend. Atmosphere was also great!
15,What an absolute gem of a restaurant! The brunch knocked my socks off and don’t even get me started with the cocktails! George made sure it was an experience of a lifetime and I can’t wait to come back!
16,"Had the lobster Benedict and was super good. George was great and served really good drinks, especially liked the French 85"
17,"We had a lovely meal here on 11/15/22 at lunch time. The food was great, the server was wonderful and the atmosphere was lovely. I ordered the buffalo chicken burger and it was too spicy for me, so the server exchanged the meal for the burger without the sauce on. I really appreciated this as it was my own fault for ordering something too spicy and they didn’t have to change it, but it they did without hesitation. It was really great service. Thank you!!!"
18,"Beautiful atmosphere of Upper West Side. Delicious food, with interesting combination of spices. Very good selection of wines. Extremely polite and friendly staff. A little bit pricey, but it really worths it."
19,"We made reservations a month ago for a birthday dinner this week a few hours after we will be arriving from JFK. Then, 48 hours before our dinner we get a call that they are having a private party and are canceling our reservation. Just like that. No apology, no accommodation, no nothing. THE WORST! Never coming back. They do not deserve your business."
20,A Saturday brunch with family. Promptly seated. Active and friendly vibe. Service was excellent and food top notch.
21,Stumbled across this place on a Sunday afternoon and super happy we checked it out! The vibes + decor are cute and cozy and the cocktails were great. Our bartender George was so friendly/attentive and made us such delicious drinks . Got the Safe Word cocktail (right in picture) and it 10/10 and refreshing - def recommend!
22,"Decided to take a brief trip to the UWS to do some Halloween Sunday shopping when we were in dire need of a drink. Stumbling in here, George greeted us with a generous smile and decadent cocktails. Amazing stop making for an amazing Sunday."
23,"We came in for an espresso martini on an overcast morning, and the consulate didn't disappoint. Very friendly staff"
24,Had some really good espresso martinis made by George! Enjoyed the friendly and elegant environment of the bar!
25,beautiful and sexy as hell bistro vibe with the best cosmo in nyc!!! ask for george he’s the best!!!!!!!!
26,"Great drinks, relaxing and refined ambiance, ask for George, he kills the Cosmo! Will definitely be back for more cocktails"
27,"The restaurant has a super cute ambiance and the cosmopolitan was one of the best I’ve ever had! A cute, quaint bistro vibe."
28,We just moved to the UWS from downtown and we’re excited to have found a fantastic eatery that paralleled to the great eating we had downtown. Additionally the service provided by Sasha was tremendous.
29,"Restaurant experiences, positive or negative, are often determined by the quality of not only the food and libations, but the quality of the staff. The Consulate gets 10-out-of-10 on all three I'm happy to say. When I arrived, the bartender was courteous and quick to acknowledge my existence on this fine orb (which is unusual these days, as most seem to enjoy the control of keeping you waiting), the Maître d' was also courteous (again, not always a given) and wasn't flustered or fussy about moving the bar tab to the table when seating us, but a special mention must go to our wonderful server, BiBi from Serbia. She was the cat's pajamas. Sweet, funny and not too overbearing, so thank you for helping make our evening a special one, BiBi. Did I mention this all went down on a Tuesday night? Yes, a Tuesday night, when most restaurants have their B teams on. Did I mention there was a live, Edith Piaf like singer making it feel like we were dining in an intimate little hideaway in Montmartre? Well, there was and she was amazing too. Did I mention that the short rib pasta and seared tuna steak dishes were outstanding? I don't believe I did, but they were and we washed it down beautifully with a cheeky little bottle of Malbec recommended by BiBi. All-in-all an amazing experience, so hats off to everyone at The Consulate, keep up the good work."
30,"My family and I regularly visit The Consulate. They have incredible food, great drinks, and top tier service. We recently were helped by George at the bar. He did a wonderful job explaining the drinks and food. Be sure to say hi if he's in! 10/10 place. Highly recommend!"
31,"Absolutely love The Consulate. Always a 10/10. Can’t beat their Happy Hour either. As a neighbor, this place is a perfect chic spot. Sit at the bar with George - he makes the best martinis! P.s. they have the best fries on the UWS!"
32,"The Consulate is such a cute little restaurant! My husband and I stopped in for some much needed Sunday afternoon drinks. We had some shopping to do on the Upper West Side and stumbled upon this wine bar along the way. The atmosphere is very welcoming and calm. It’s a great spot to relax, people watch, and have a refreshing drink. I got their Chenin Blanc. I have a lot of trouble finding bars or restaurants that carry this kind of wine and since it’s my absolute favorite type I will be back for more. George was our bartender! He was very attentive and always had a smile on his face! I think we found our new spot!"
33,I’ve gone to a lot of bars and wine bars in the area but I keep coming back to the Consulate. The vibe is perfect and the people working there are awesome. Ask for George behind the bar he is the best.
34,"When a favorite server of ours from an East Side restaurant we frequented moved here, we had to check it out. My wife and a friend headed for The Consulate for the first time. The ambience is pleasant with tables well spaced. The vibe is lively. The food is quite good. We started with shared burrata and smoke salmon flatbread (quite original). The main courses were seafood pasta, a Consulate burger and my choice seared duck breast. All delicious and more than we could eat. The pineapple cake dessert was a disappointment. Mother made better. Best of all, Bibi (Biljana) was there cracking jokes. The owners came over to say hello. We'll go back."
35,I love love love the consulate! Great happy hour deal and the best vibes. The mademoiselle cocktail is amazing! George was our bartender and he’s great!!
36,I used Trip Advisor to find this highly rated restaurant. We visited here on a Saturday evening. We were early so the place was still not too busy.  We were disappointed with the quality of service; the limited and high priced wine list; the food was just average. The pasta was over cooked. Not impressed with any of our dishes we ordered to share - it was just average.  For the high ranking for this restaurant I do nit think it is anything special and not worth going out of your way.
37,"This place had #3 rating at Tripadvisor, but it doesn’t hold up. (I, personally, even suspect that rating is influenced by bots).  This place has too many sitting places for its capacity, hence too crowded, too noisy and the staff is overwhelmed.  Though the food and the place try to seem “high-society”, the quality just doesn’t hold up. The steak was barely eatable and the fish hasn’t left any emotion but regret.  That is even more upsetting, as the prices are 20-30% higher then you would expect from such a place"
38,We had big expectations about the restaurant being so highly reviewed but in reality is nothing special. Basic food just overpriced.
39,"I sat at the bar, and George took wonderful care of me. Service was very fast, and both the food and drinks were excellent. The brunch burger is one of my favorites on the west side. I have been here a number of times, and have enjoyed every experience."
40,My girls and I enjoyed a drink and dinner at the bar with our bartender George. We had the rib-eye and Brussels sprouts. Perfect place for a drink and dinner with friends or for a romantic date. The patio doors were open which allowed for a cool breeze. We will definitely be back!
41,"The most charming, sensuous atmosphere with incredible food and cocktails by George, that are to die for! The perfect date night spot!"
42,We were in the UWS for lunch and stumbled across this historic building. We realized it was a restaurant named the Consulate and started to have drinks here and ended up speaking to this friendly staff- George Def we will be coming back for sure
43,Got the Croque Monsieur and the taste was unbelievable! Highly recommend. For my experience I sat at the bar and George was a pleasure to be served by.
44,The bartender George was very attentive and made great conversation while serving us on a sunny afternoon
45,Great drinks and service with George! Beautiful bar and great open area by the bar. Not too loud and very friendly staff!
46,"We live on the UWS and this is our go to spot. It has amazing vibes, great food and George makes the best drinks!!"
47,the miss ohara is delicious! My fiance got the three shades of green with vodka and it was so refreshing. the jardin is my favorite. George makes the best drinks. Highly recommend!!!
48,"We dined here on the July 4th holiday weekend pre-theater with visiting relatives and they weren’t very busy so we could really enjoy the lovely atmosphere. I’d read great reviews, but still felt that it was a crapshoot because we’ve been to a number of highly reviewed restaurants in NYC, and found many of them to be average or disappointing. To be honest, I was afraid that the reviews I read might not be real reviews, so I’m a genuine customer, and yes, the food was very good, and the service was great. The specialty cocktails are top notch. Our son said it was the best hamburger he ever had. Two people ordered the duck special and said it was very good. The mushroom and truffle flatbread pizza was really good. The grilled octopus was quite good and so was the skate. The pineapple upside down cake was exceptional. We will definitely return, but I imagine that they get very busy when it’s not a holiday weekend."
49,Had Saturday brunch here. Great setting and the food was very good. We all started with cocktails and then switched to wine. We shared dessert and the tiramisu was excellent! Would recommend for brunch.
50,"The consulate is the best! Perfect spot for a spritz on a hot summer day. The overall vibe and service is top notch. Ask for George, he’s the best!"
51,"After reading the ratings decided to visit. Unfortunately on Saturday al 2 PM only brunch menu available. So we couldn’t choose much. Our toast with avocado , salmon and egg were very very good. Choice of beers insufficient for a place this kind. No draft not Corona. I hope I can go again and try the full menu. Was quite expensive for what we had."
52,"The atmosphere alone is worth the visit, but luckily the everything else is equally on point. The food is exquisite, the cocktail’s quality and variety will give everyone options; while the lovely staff rounds out a wonderful experience that will keep you coming back for more. We have been here multiple times and each time it is consistently good!"
53,"Stumbled upon this place on my way to Central Park and the Met, solely because it looked so pretty from the outside. I can’t emphasize enough how much I loved ending up here for a brunch. I got some mimosa and avocado toast, prob the best avocado toast I’ve had in my life!  The bartender is not only super cute but also very kind and sweet! I absolutely loved the ambience and the decor, to add to the wholesome experience!"
54,"The food, cocktails and location are fantastic. The best tuna I have ever had in my life! If you are in NU you have to try this place."
55,"My friend and I had lunch this past Wed. We ate inside. All the doors were open so we had the best of inside and outside. I had the shrimp on toast. Large, perfectly cooked shrimp in the most wonderful smokey, sauce. Little heat, lots of depth. Also the wild mushrooms on flatbread...lovely. My friend had the pasta and clams. Loved it. we discussed liking the plates. I think she was only half joking. Lovely service, pleasant ambiance and great food. Will be back ."
56,Best drinks in the world! I will always remember this restaurant to be one of my highlights of New York! I had The Touch of Ginger and I highly recommend it!
57,I wish I could have ordered every cocktail on the menu. Everything is expertly made and the service is wonderful. Check this place out next time you’re in the area.
58,"We had a couples dinner here one weekday evening and sat on one of the pavement tables. The restaurant has a very friendly vibe - thanks in large part to the attentive service. The food was very good too, with quality ingredients, nicely cooked and beautifully presented. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
59,Very nice dinner with friends in the open space. Excellent food combined with good service. Particularly the pasta dishes were excellent! Recommend
60,"Very nice vibes and atmosphere here, the menu has something for everyone and the drinks are 10/10. I recommend ‘Your love is King’"
61,"The Consulate is absolutely repeat worthy.  My partner and I initially came in on a Friday-evening self-led bar crawl for our favorite espresso martini in our neighborhood (Manhattan's Upper West Side). The Consulate was a clear winner (and the fingerling potatoes were delicious).  On another venture here, we ordered espresso martinis again and additional dishes that the kitchen made dairy-free with ease (fingerlings, again, as well as miso-glazed eggplant and broccolini).  The service is efficient, talented, and friendly. And the ambiance, well, you'll just have to come in and experience that for yourself."
62,"Love this spot! Great atmosphere, music, bar, and flatbread! This is my go to spot when catching up with old friends on UWS. Highly recommend you won’t be disappointed."
63,My friend and I stopped in for martinis and an app while we were strolling through the UWS. Fantastic spot and fantastic service! The playlist was fire which always makes for a great experience in my book. The martinis were perfect and the food was tasty. Will come back ASAP.
64,The bartender!! The drinks! The appetizers!! So much fun!!! Come for a visit and tell George Billy and Lisa say hello!!
65,"Since we moved to the UWS last year, this has been an excellent source of high end cocktails (the Consulate Old Fashioned!) and great food (wild mushroom flatbread!)"
66,"Friendly staff, excellent drinks and food, the Bartender is amazing, great spot to hangout and enjoy in the perfect service! 👍"
67,Favorite bar/resto on the UWS. Perfectly delightful cocktails and friendly staff. It’s a great place to recharge during an afternoon at Central Park.
68,Such a fun and cute restaurant with great drinks and food. The environment is super warm and inviting and fun hang.
69,Gorgeous place and delicious drinks. Pleasant bartenders. Everyone is very helpful and knowledgeable. Must see place!
70,"A fantastic space in the heart of the Upper West Side. They have great craft cocktails and nightly dinner specials. The roast duck is a favorite! For brunch, the Croque Monsieur is great. Wine list changes regularly, featuring new reds/whites that pair well with the French-American fare. Service is wonderful. Yelena and George are fantastic at the bar, in particular. A great experience for date nights or a solo trip to the bar for happy hour. Cuisine is always fresh and paired with the attentive and knowledgeable service, it can’t be beaten. A must visit on the UWS!"
71,We had a great lunch here. The staff did everything to make our experience special. The mushroom gnocchi is to die for. It’s a little bit off but so worth the detour. They are looking to open near midtown as well. Hope so. We will come back next time we visit New York.
72,"Beautiful ambiance, delicious drinks and considerate bartender. We had a wonderful evening on the upper west side and sampled 4 of the cocktails which were consistently excellent."
73,Beautiful service and beverages. Amazing bartender! We love. We ordered three drinks and the bartender was very accommodating.
74,Such incredible cocktails and service . Had the Jardin and it was delicious!! Would recommend and will be coming again!
75,The happy hour drink specials are amazing. This matcha jalapeño cocktail is so unique and tasty! Plus a friendly bartender and staff!
76,"The Consulate has the most exquisite cocktails in the city, and each bartender is incredibly kind/talented. George makes the best espresso martinis in Manhattan and that’s saying something!"
77,"The service, ambiance, and service is excellent! Relaxed atmosphere with no pressure. The octopus appetizer is tender and beautifully plated- delicious. The kale/ Brussels sprout salad is so light and flavorful. Wonderful meal and I’m grateful I ventured in on a whim!"
78,"Great staff, great ambiance, and an excellent old fashioned. Good spot for a date night or just a classy night out in the neighborhood."
79,This restaurant is great for a date night or just drinks before dinner. It has an intimate vibe with a fantastic dinner menu and the best espresso martini on the UWS!
80,Cool brunch place with tasty onion soup close to a city bike station and central park. Gorge was helpful choosing our with drinks.
81,Amazing vibe and the bartenders are such lovely people. Visited from uptown on a busy Easter brunch and sat at the bar and they were absolutely lovely and so accommodating. Highly recommend
82,"Wow. Truly a gem of the Upper West Side. This place has a striking, handsome U-shaped bar in the middle of the restaurant, lots of plants and interesting decorations that add so much character, a really cool silver-plated ceiling, classic-feeling music that fits perfectly with the environment, and very friendly waitstaff. George at the bar makes a delightful espresso martini. Don’t miss out."
83,"The Consulate is such a great, very sophisticated place for any occasion! The food, the drinks, the service and the ambiance were all exceptional! I went just for a few drinks with my girlfriends and had an amazing experience the food is great, especially the mussels, they were so good and fresh!! Absolutely coming back"
84,Noisy on a Saturday at 12 noon. Tables very close together but room well decorated. Bloody Mary great but eggs Benedict a bit cold. Food was average.
85,"The drinks are fantastic, very smooth. The place has a unique atmosphere and the food is very nice.."
86,"After living on the UWS for two years, I finally stopped in for an afternoon coffee and was utter charmed by the environment and the people. Whether you’re in search of a quick drink or a sit down meal, you’re sure to be greeted by amenable staff and a lovely time."
87,"Great space, great coffee, great service, great location. I would absolutely come back for drinks or even dinner."
88,"The first thing that stood out is that they have a proper mocktails menu and not an afterthought of standard sodas, which is often a disappointment at nicer restaurants.  Arrived to find Friday and Saturday are exempt from happy hour but stayed and ordered a salad, entree and two drinks.  Great staff, good food --- and drinks didn't skimp out. Got the frisee salad (recommend) and steak fries (actually prefer the short rib cavatelli, personally)."
89,"Great cocktails and bites! We had espresso martinis, manhattans, steak tartare and mushroom flatbread - all very delicious"
90,Gorgeous atmosphere and great vibes. Stunning lighting and excellent service. Sit at the bar for tons of attention and perfect cocktails. Great bartenders and servers. Highly recommend the Jardin and the Oui Mademoiselle. Happy hour at the bar 4-6pm!
91,We sat at the bar for a date night and the experience couldn’t have been better! The drinks were amazing and the bartenders were so attentive.I would definitely come back here. Recommend this spot 10/10!
92,"I am new to the UWS and my husband and I decided to check out The Consulate, and boy am I glad we did.  The drinks are great and the brunch menu is top notch.  If you are in the area and looking for drinks or a bite to eat I highly recommend checking this place out."
93,Stopped by to grab a quick drink during brunch. Ended up ordering the açaí bowl with granola which was a perfect way to start my day! Highly recommend.
94,Such kind staff and a great establishment. What a gem. Highly recommend! From your entry until you leaveC these folks know how to craft an experience.
95,"My fiance and I came to The Consulate the first time we visited NYC together, when we were looking for an apartment to move into. At the time, it was the perfect spot to decompress and relax between showings. Soon enough, we moved to the UWS and have become locals. Not only are the cocktails amazing (our favs are the le jardin and oui mademoiselle) but the food the AMAZING. The Brussels salad, short rib cavatelli, wild mushroom pasta, roasted chicken, and CRÈME BRÛLÉE are top notch. The staff is also always very friendly, accommodating and polite. Definitely a place I will come back to and bring visitors."
96,Beautiful spot! Everything from the ambience to service was top notch. If you’re in the neighborhood definitely stop by.
97,"Excellent cocktails, decor and waiting staff! Dim lighting and chill vibes! Upper West side is where to go! Get the Jardin!"
98,"A Great spot for french-american fare on the Upper West Side! Great craft cocktails. George and Yelena at the bar are fantastic! Great service and delicious food options. Daily specials are always a plus and make it worth going back. A true UWS gem with fantastic cocktails, food options, and service. Definitely worth a shot for date night, business meeting, or just solo for happy hour. A must try! Burger and steak frites are delicious!  The brunch is great and one of the best Croque Monsieurs I have ever had. Pancakes are huge and delicious. I would also recommend the Nutella French Toast. Absolutely delicious!"
99,"Eyed this place for awhile and glad we finally stopped in on a Monday happy hour for drinks and apps. Friendly bartender and good drinks! Recommend the consulate old fashioned if you like Mezcal, and the Brussels sprouts with bacon. Good ambiance!"
100,"While in NYC to see Broadway plays, go to museums, and watch the St Patrick’s Day parade, we wanted a restaurant we had not visited before, so we made reservations for two through OpenTable and had dinner at The Consulate on the Upper East Side. We thoroughly enjoyed everything about the restaurant and dinner. The restaurant was cozy and well appointed. The Consulate staff was friendly, courteous, and prompt in meeting our every need. They were subtly in the background, ready to step in whenever something was required – refilling water glasses, taking and filling our orders, sweeping crumbs from the table, or resetting table ware between courses. The proprietors, two brothers and a sister, were there working and interacting with guests. Bartender, sister made nice pre-dinner martinis. Co-owner Igor, as sommelier, suggested a few fine wines from a good list of domestic and foreign wineries. We chose a jammy, juicy NAPA cabernet that was excellent and is now on our home wine list. Little Brother Kosta (both men over six feet tall) served as our waiter. We shared a wonderful, lightly-smoked, barbequed artichoke for an appetizer and a Caesar salad. We chose pastas for our entrées. One was a tasty, cheesy crab trophie. The other was a short rib cavatelli that won the taste contest between the two. In fact, given a choice we would choose that short-rib cavatelli over classical French boeuf bourguignons. Yes, there was dessert as well, a smooth crème broulèe. We look forward to dining at The Consulate on our next trip to NYC."
101,"Incredible martinis I! Thank you George for amazing service. We loved our experience, the ambiance was great too thank you"
102,We had a splendid time at The Consulate! The cocktails are phenomenal and the service was exceptional. I absolutely recommend this place for a cozy meal or casual cocktails at the bar. A gem in the UWS.
103,"Best espresso martinis in UWS! Love this place and keep coming back, the staff and energy is always great. Happy hour Monday-Thursday is wonderful for the area"
104,Great food and tasty cocktails. Bartender is awesome ❤️ Definitely one of the best places to visit in NYC.
105,Favorite brunch spot in the Upper west side. Right near the museum. Great food. Great service. And even better people. Can’t wait to come back.
106,"The cutest spot ever! The bartender was awesome. We had brunch, also the perfect date night spot! Beautiful area, outdoor dining is cute as well! GO GO GO!"
107,"If you are a billionaire and want to be ripped off this is the place for you! I ordered a cosmo it showed up in a half filled in a martini glass. It was $20, as someone who rarely drinks I know when there is no alcohol This was my BF new favorite place but he we will never be back, refills of club soda were so expensive he would not discuss it. Yelena the bartender was downright rude. If you want a drink with alcohol go somewhere else. Should have taken a photo. Each club soda was over $3. This is how you treat regulars??"
108,"We had a great time at the restaurant, the atmosphere is cosy and elegant, the cocktails are delicious (I recommend the Oui Mademoiselle which is simply excellent) and the food is delicious, rather hearty. The service is also perfect. It's really the place to go for a lunch or dinner with friends or lovers, you won't be disappointed!"
109,"If you're looking for a cocktail bar with good vibes in the upper west side check out The Consulate. I had ""El Jardin"" made with jalapeño infused tequila that definitely didn't disappoint. I'll be coming back for dinner soon!"
110,"Awesome happy hour, definitely get the mushroom flatbread! Highly recommend. Great interior design as well! Love this place."
111,"The UWS has tons on incredible food but the Consulate is our absolute favorite. Their brunch is delicious. We always order the same delicious items: the croque monsieur, kale salad, French onion soup, fries and some spritz’s. The restaurant itself is soooo cute. Very spacious and French country inspired decor. It’s really a cut above the rest and the service is impeccable. The nicest staff!"
112,"The consulate has very friendly staff and truly delicious food. I ordered the croque monster and it was hands down one of the best I had in new York city. And I am a big foodie. My friend had the salmon Benedict and it was absolutely delightful, light, fresh and delicious Overall, highly recommend the consulate for your next meal!"
113,"Delicious beverages, bartenders are amazing!!!! Great service, cute ambience, tasty pancakes, lovely lighting."
114,"Wonderful food, service, and cocktails. A great place for a good. tasty, affordable Sunday brunch that isn’t too wild. Excellent service and cocktails."
115,"Been to The Consulate a few times for dinner and brunch and I’ve always enjoyed the experience. The drinks are delicious and the brunch is exactly what you want on the weekend - waffles are heavenly, plenty of sweet and savory options to choose from. My boyfriend and I will be back!"
116,"If you are ever in the upper west side and looking for a delicious brunch, please stop by the consulate as the pancakes and Benedicts are the best in the upper neighborhoods! Lobster Benedict is exceptional and the cast iron pancakes are out of this world"
117,My husband and I were in New York for vacation. We got caught in a rainstorm and ended up at The Consulate. We’re so glad we happened up this place. The Manhattan I ordered was perfect. The bartender was kind and knowledgeable. We stayed for hours and I can’t recommend this place more.
118,Randomly stopped in to get out of the rain at 1045 on a Saturday morning. Super friendly staff. Brunch drinks were delightful. Not too loud. Bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area.  We are restaurant owners so we are always looking for great spots. This one checked all the boxes!
119,"Incredible must-try house cocktails, especially the Miss O’Hara! The truffle and mushroom flatbread is so good it made me forget I don’t like mushrooms, and I really loved the fresh figs in the Frisée salad. The noise level is moderate so it’s good for conversations, while keeping the dinner lively. The decor on the walls is beautiful and there’s great ambiance at the bar."
120,"Best hidden happy hour on the UWS. Mushroom flatbread is fantastic! Bar tenders are very, very kind. Quick service and lovely NYC patrons."
121,Delicious cocktails and lovely bar ambiance. We ate before drinks but the smells coming from other diners’ plates are making us regretful. Will definitely be back for more drinks and with an appetite as well
122,"Great service, food, and atmosphere as I had dinner and drinks at the bar. I really appreciated the extensive cocktail menu as well as great wine selection"
123,"Good service. Good food. Good drinks. Sat at the bar great ambiance, got a whiskey sour and a signature cocktail. Started off with some apps and finished with the short rib cavatelli."
124,Cozy and elegant Upper West Side cocktail bar featuring outstanding service and an excellent happy hour! Try the Consulate Old Fashioned. Cheers!
125,"We weren’t planning to come in, but the incredible ambiance and set up inside literally drew us in from the street. The restaurant itself is very clean and presentable which is very inviting. Staff is very friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and extremely professional. The cocktail menu is high end and very tasty, and the presentation is beautiful. Highly recommend the Rising Sun cocktail for a light, refreshing and satisfying drink on a warm day. (Pictured below with Old Fashioned). We will definitely come back for dinner at some point!"
126,"I was lured in by the French onion soup spotted on a tray from a waiter outside, so decided to stop and try it for myself. It did not disappoint. The bar staff were extremely attentive and friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience."
127,"They were able to accommodate my request for a bunless burger, which I appreciated. Food was delicious and the servers very friendly. Very nice ambience. Highly recommend!"
128,"Food was great, my steak was cooked perfectly. My partner had the burger and she also said it was delicious. I also recommend the Consulate Old Fashioned."
129,"Great cocktails, great food and great service. I come here as frequently as I can and want to make it my neighborhood haunt."
130,"Wow, how lucky was I to stumble upon The Consulate last night! We just had to come back again today. Superb cocktails, wonderful service, and a chic atmosphere."
131,"I came here solo to kill time, and I wish I would have had time to stay longer! I ordered a cocktail at the bar, and everyone on staff that interacted with me was super friendly. I got a boulevardier, and it was delicious. Would 100% come here again."
132,Just bought a penthouse apartment on upper west side and love this place across the street. Happy hour was fab and food was delish.
133,Went here for Happy Hour for a celebration! Has a great ambiance and yummy appetizers- we got the artichokes and the rosemary French fries - yum! we had a couple of glasses of wine and a glass of amaretto. The perfect happy hour! Enjoy.
134,"Best cocktail bar in UWS - Best staff, drinks are amazing, happy hour food is great as well. Highly reccommend the Rusty sour"
135,The consulate is a gem on the UWS! It has great cocktails and the bartender George is so nice! We live in the neighborhood and come here regularly!
136,"George saved us with negronis and fries, but the hagiography should be saved for the crispy maitake mushrooms with harissa aioli. To die for, but only if the afterlife is more snacks and drinks."
137,"I love the vibe at the Consulate. We come frequently and the drinks are always great, as is the food. The bartender George was the best! Highly recommend the salmon flatbread!"
138,Stumbled upon this spot while taking a weekend stroll and we are so glad we did. Incredible cocktails and the bartender George is amazing and knows what he is doing.
139,"Gorgeous decore highlights a stunning sense luxury. Incredible food, fun and laughs. In need of guidance, gallant George behind the counter will help with suggestions and whip up unforgettable beverages, 10/10."
140,"Had an amaaaazing brunch with delicious drinks from the bartender, George. One of my fave spots in the UWS"
141,"Awesome food and great service, George the bartender is the best! Will be back next time I’m in New York visiting friends."
142,Amazing cozy restaurant for dinner. The decor of the place is very beautiful as well. Food was outstanding. Would recommend making a reservation. Will visit again for sure.
143,I celebrated my birthday with my friend at The Consulate and couldn’t have asked for a better experience. I’ve lived in the neighborhood for years and always admired the decor through the windows. We sat and the bar and the bartender George was lovely and so knowledgeable. He poured us two of the best drinks I’ve had in this neighborhood. I will definitely come back.
144,"My friend and I had one of our best experiences on the UWS celebrating her birthday at the Consulate. Our bartender George made us outstanding cocktails and was incredibly warm and welcoming. The space is beautiful - excellent decoration, music and overall atmosphere. I would highly recommend this for a date night. We will definitely be returning."
145,Loved a fantastic dinner at the bar with a delicious cocktail. George the bartender makes a mean martini. Service is fantastic and the ambiance is both elegant and hip. Food is top notch.
146,"I stopped in on a Tuesday evening wanting to unwind and relax. I got exactly what I was looking for. I was created friendly and warm. The atmosphere and lighting is great. Tuesday evening was just the right amount of lively. I sat at the bar so I could overlook the restaurant. George was my bartender. I had the steak tartar which is my favorite dish and it was delicious. Highly recommend for a great night out solo, with a date or friends."
147,"Great atmosphere, great drinks, great service, and all around great place. Lovely spot for a date or a nice dinner. 10/10 recommend!"
148,"I came to The Consulate as celebration after taking (and passing) my first two exams of the new year. I thought I’d be getting the restaurant week deals but figured that even without, I deserved a nice meal. I got the Touch of Ginger cocktail which is the perfect mix of spicy and sweet from the ginger and the mango purée. I’m normally not a fan of bourbon, but LOVE ginger and really enjoyed the drink - so much so that I couldn’t wait to get a picture of it. For dinner, I got the Korean BBQ steak with a side of French fries. The fries were just the right mix of fluffy with crisp exterior. The steak was extremely well cooked and went super well with the sauce that it was served with. My only complaint is that the pickled cucumbers could have been pickled in the sauce to give them a bit more flavor, but all in all, it was a very enjoyable, celebratory meal."
149,"Well designed atmosphere, professional and friendly staff, delicious dishes and creative bar. Every visit is memorable experience."
150,"We have been frequent guests to the Consulate! The food is great and the drinks are fabulous! Ambiance is 10/10. Thank you George for being a great bartender! Amir, Sarah and Cara"
151,George was simply lovely. The entire staff welcomed me with open arms! 2nd visit and I am so thrilled. Beautiful ambience!:)
152,"The ambience, food, and drinks here are exceptional! Would definitely recommend. Thanks, George, for the delicious espresso martini!"
153,"Very cozy, upscale bar with amazing cocktails and service. Thank you George for the delicious drinks!"
154,"The Wild Mushroom and Truffle Flatbreads is ridiculous. The name is deceiving—it’s really goat cheese mushroom pizza, but with truffle oil. All for 20 bucks. Amazing!  George, the bartender, pours a healthy whiskey with a smile.  The decor is top notch, the food is top notch, the service is top notch. If The Consulate were located downtown and these weren’t Covid time, it would be in the running as a destination restaurant.  The UWS is lucky to have this gem and I hope it stays here for a while.  13/10"
155,"the decor is a total 10. The service was excellent. Nikola the manager treated us with such care we felt like we were talking to a long time friend. Now the food was next level and the drinks Wow !! So delicious and definitely instagram worthy. Overall it was a great experience. Food, cocktails and service was amazing. Definitely coming back."
156,Our handsome bartender George from Serbia made me the most delicious Old Fashioned in the chicest setting with amazing French music at their incredible bar!
157,"The Consulate is quite close to my location and a great place for me to enjoy a glas of wine at the end of my day. Staff is extremely friendly and sitting at the bar calms me down at the end of a busy day. Georg, the bartender, made me feel like coming back home straight away…. Can only recommend… Maggie"
158,"If you’re looking for that elusive New York bar, where you have great drinks in a chill environment, this is your place. Thanks George!"
159,This is a great spot on UWS for drinks. Really cute interior with warm ambiance. George makes great cocktails!
160,"The mussels, French onion soup, and steak tartare are great. Drinks are delicious too, we had the Touch of Ginger and The Rising Sun are a must."
161,"The Consulate is a perfect place to grab a drink, grab dinner and the staff is incredibly warm and friendly! The food is awesome and the drinks are perfectly balanced! Catch George behind the bar, he makes a mean Dirty Martini!"
162,"Popped in for an espresso martini on a Saturday afternoon & our bartender, George, made an amazing cocktail. Very cozy spot on a cold winter day, will definitely be back!"
163,Went for drinks with friends on a Saturday afternoon out. George was the best bartender and made THE best espresso martini I’ve ever had! Definitely recommend.
164,"Perfect place that delivers on food, atmosphere, ambiance and the most incredible bar service! George is an expert mixologist who makes the Most delicious drinks - plus has an impressive wine knowledge. Mushroom flatbread pizza, mussels in white white and garlic with crusty bread, Consulate burger, and short rib cavatelli are just a few of the many tasty menu options. My husband, a Caesar salad aficionado, claims theirs is one of his top three- worldwide! We typically dine at the bar but the restaurant area is just as inviting. Their attention to cleanliness is reassuring as well. Truly one of our top places in the 10024 neighborhood - on Columbus Ave just a block from Central Park."
165,Excellent restaurant with laid back vibe. Great drinks and food - would thoroughly recommend! George is great behind the bar!
166,"Great place with great food, drinks, service - especially George. Highly recommend the flatbreads or tartare. Must try on UWS!"
167,"The best hospitality with friendly stuff, good food and nice cocktails. Good place to hung out after work!"
168,"I will be honest, it is hard finding a quality restaurant open on Christmas. Even in a big city like NY. Yet my search was not in vain, I walked by a lovely place called the consulate. Located on the Upper west side, away from the madness of midtown, this modern french/American style blends well in a neighborhood known for its variety of cuisine. Being alone on Christmas can be made better, with a good place to eat and drink, and the Consulate hit every mark. From the fabulous wine and cocktail selection, to the beautiful decor of the horse shoe bar, this place made me feel at home. Not to mention the food. I had marinated shrimp toast, perfect starter, followed by a Barratta salad made with not only tomatos, but strawberries. I finished with a mushroom gnocchi, and a side of a whole fried lotus onion, which went perfectly with the gnocchi. The staff was warm and attentive, with George behind the bar. Fabulous service from him. Come on by this place, they made me feel like family on a day I was away from mine."
169,The consulate was a great experience. I went for brunch on a Saturday and had the fluffiest pancakes and wait staff was super friendly. George at the bar was particularly inviting and easy to talk to. 10/10 would recommend!
170,Stumbled into this cute local spot for brunch and sat at the bar with the amazing George! The service was impeccable and the food delish! Highly recommending this place!
171,This is a beautiful restaurant with fabulous food. Every dish was delicious. We were a large group so we shared many things which allowed us to sample a lot of food. I had the duck but also tasted the pasta with ribs and a variety of yummy appetizers. Cocktails were original and quite good and the service was exceptional.
172,I was recently at the Consulate for dinner with my sister. We were both immediately impressed with the cozy / welcoming atmosphere when we walked inside. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Gnocchi and my sister ordered one of the daily specials and we both LOVED our dishes. The restaurant staff was also super friendly and accommodating and I can't wait to go back.
173,"I came in here randomly and was very pleased with the food and service. There was a small lunch rush around noon and the place was just busy enough without being crowded. The servers were very accommodating and mine made a recommendation for a drink I ended up loving. I got the mussels which were delicious, I would go back for them for sure. Overall great ambiance, good music, I would recommend to any friend!"
174,"Beautiful restaurant on upper west side, close to Central Park. Excellent cocktails and the food is delicious having a menu with a lot of choices with a french twist."
175,"An excellent experience. The setting is wonderful balance of cozy and elegant. Even with a full house on a Saturday night, the service was fantastic. Never had to ask or wait. Our group had pasta, branzino, mushroom bread, and adored every bite. Thank you George!!"
176,"My fiancé and I go to The Consulate at least 3x a week- from their amazing breakfast (specifically The Consulate Omelette) to their incredible dinner menu (we love the short rib cavatelli, grilled artichoke, mussels, chicken) - you can’t go wrong with any meal here! We are so happy we live in this neighborhood and have a restaurant like this to eat at! Great food, service and ambiance!"
177,"....and that's all you need to eat here. Everything else we had was just average but the short rib pasta was incredible. Service was also odd, we had 3 servers during our meal."
178,"We had a great dinner, our server Bojan was friendly and knowledgeable, we sat inside ond it was such wonderful ambience, the food was delicious, the arctic cod as had an amazing side salad and it was a large portion. Definitely will come back, a great new find in the City."
179,"This is a great restaurant to go to, but we just ordered, had it confirmed, and then cancelled. No explanation and no phone to call. Outrageous."
180,"From the moment you enter the door to the moment you leave, The Consulate takes you on a trip around the world with a wonderfully romantic atmosphere. If you don’t know exactly what you’re getting yourself into, you don’t have to worry! Our server Mike answered all of our questions describing the spices and flavors of dishes, the texture of each meat, and the taste of different cocktails we were considering. He didn’t steer us wrong all night! We loved getting to try some foods and cocktails we wouldn’t have gotten to anywhere else. We can’t wait to come back for the next country in 3 months!"
181,service was incredible. food was delicious. good price. definitively recommend! outdoor space is perfectly done
182,"we had dinner on thanksgiving and loved it. The outside seating is great, we had an open ""window"" on one side, and the front totally open as well as a heater on top. Perfect arrangement. Service was wonderful as was the food. Would highly recommend."
183,"Good food. Good location. Unfortunately they miss the mark for Covid precautions and as a result we won’t be back and neither will our friends. Wait staff wearing spit guards not masks. Our waitress complied with our request that she put on a proper mask but the rest of the waiters did not. There’s no visible hand sanitation, and it would have been preferably to have plastic between tables. Too bad as we want to support our neighborhood establishment"
184,It was our first foray back into the NY restaurant scene. The Consulate gets high marks for working hard to make the outdoor setting seem inviting. There are plants all around. And the tables are spaced far apart. The lunch menu had a multitude of options and everything all around is looked appetizing and well prepared. There are not nearly enough good UWS restaurant choices so grateful to have the Consulate.
185,"Great French restaurant on the UWS. Great food, great service and a great atmosphere. Comprehensive menu and wine list. We sat at the bar where we could chat with the (knowledgable) barman, who makes a mean Negroni. Enjoyed a spicy steak tartare followed by the skate which was divine. Can't recommend it too highly!!"
186,"This location on the northeast corner of Columbus and 85th has hosted a restaurant for well over one third of a century. The most recent resident is The Consulate, a French restaurant with old world charm and an excellent wine list. The past tenant, Machiavelli, with their Renaissance panoramas has been set aside and completely transformed save for the black and white tiled floor. The bar has been expanded, the old original brick work exposed, and a tin ceiling added. I have eaten there for brunch and dinner and enjoyed almost everything on the menu particularly the skate, the branzino, and the steak frites. To start I have enjoyed the French onion soup and the Caesar salad. I have also come early for drinks and the bar is welcoming and pleasant."
187,This is definitely a go-to restaurant on the Upper West Side. The food is imaginative and high quality and the service is excellent. We thought the atmosphere was comfortable and we could actually have a conversation over dinner.
188,Hospitality defines the Royalty treatment of the Professional Staff in The Consulate I Proud To Said THE BEST FRENCH RESTAURANT IN THE UPPER WESTSIDE. Our unforgettable dining experience begins with the warm welcome of Kiril Owner/Partner who with a sincere smile confirmed our reservation and directed Us to our table That night my husband and I celebrated our 31st wedding anniversary Our server Angie made Us feel special when she arrived to the table with 2 glasses of champagne send by Miki Owner/Partner to toast for our 31st wedding anniversary To Start our special celebration I ordered a delicious Oui mademoiselle and my husband Rising sun both speciality cocktails made by the best bartender of the Upper West Side Milan Owner/Partner Angie explained Us the daily specials and this is what We ordered: 2 appetizers to share escargot and chicory salad Both appetizers were a taste for adventure The escargot defines expectations with melt in mouth texture and delicious garlic butter sauce The chicory salad was fresh crunchy tasty well balanced tossed with Chef Alan secret salad dressing delicious Igor Owner/Partner And Master Sommelier opened a bottle of 1989 Chateau de Beaucastel Chateauneuf du pape What a incredible feast the Professional Staff of The Consulate was giving Us For main course my husband ordered the 45 days dried aged rib-eye steak and I ordered mafaldine pasta with wild boar ragú his 45 days dried aged rib-eye steak was exceptionally tender flavorful with a lot of marbling reflecting meat quality my mafaldine pasta with wild boar ragú was unique juicy and succulent the San Marzano Tomato was and extraordinary match balance taste and rich flavor After We finished our meal We were surprised with a homemade coconut flan and homemade tiramisu both desserts with the number 31 and the staff sang Us Happy Anniversary To enjoy our desserts We ordered 2 expresos and 2 sambuca Thanks A Lot To All The Professional Staff Of The Consulate The Best French Restaurant In The Upper Westside And This Most Enjoyable Dining Experience It Is Going To Became A Tradition In My Family
189,"I have been to The Consulate a few times now for multiple occasions. The service, food, music and beauty of the place can’t be compared to other local restaurants. Amazing staff, great location and absolutely perfect brunch and dinner spot. Every plate of food and cocktail is handled with extra detail and care. Some of my favorites are the carrots three ways, steak tartare, apple tart, creme brule, avocado toast and fries, although EVERYTHING is delicious! Highly recommend!!"
190,Steak tartare to die for! Also ordered Carrots Three Ways and it was delicious. Great atmosphere + drinks + service = The Consulate.
191,"I been there with 5 of my friends two night's ago and we had a great time. I love the food and cocktails and music was amazing. We had so much fun at the bar first, and then we moved at the table for dinner. I really recommend this place."
192,"I've come to Consulate mostly for lunch and brunch. Have not yet tried it for dinner. Went with a friend for Happy Hour last evening. Was nice and relaxed, with a nice selection of Happy Hour drinks and snacks. The interior renovation from what was Machiavelli is very warm and inviting. Milan, the bartender, and Mickie the host were both attentive and welcoming. Worth a visit!"
193,"I went to the consulate with a very close friend and it was outstanding, from the hostess to the food/dessert. A gentleman helped us with our table (he gave us a few options ~ making sure we would enjoy or evening~) but we end up at the bar counter. I was hypnotized with everything; and I have to mention the seats at the bar. Omg! This is the first restaurant in NYC that I got that high chair with a back support and it was so amazing because my friend is pregnant and I wanted her to be comfortable. These seat are extremely comfy, cute and it gives an UP at this place.  Like I said before I choose the bar because I really liked it but because they have an amazing happy hour from 4pm until 7pm! Guys!! There’s beef sliders, smoked salmon flatbread, Wild mushroom and truffle flatbread, escargots, fois gras and more snacks. Cocktails for $9, beers $7 and wine $9. I took advantage of this and we got two flatbreads (one of each), my friend got a mocktail and I got 3 cocktails. I wanted to try different cocktails because all of them looked so yummy (OMG!! they have flavored ice balls for cocktails) I started with an old fashioned, then I tried one with the ginger called a touch of ginger (also made with bourbon), I wanted to try something else but this ginger guy just got me. You know?! The best cocktail I’ve had! (I had 2 of theses)  Hey, consulate!!! I need this recipe.  I could stay here talking about every little details because my experience was really outstanding. But if I were you I would go there and see everything yourself; I guarantee that you won’t regret it! Please try the ginger drink for me!  Thanks for this amazing afternoon/evening, consulate.  I can’t wait for my next visit!!!"
194,"My BFF, Jill, and I were not sure where to eat. Looked in the window not many people. Decided let’s go in. Atmosphere and ambience felt like a European cafe, decor very welcoming, beautiful bar and well stocked....the best was the staff!! Nick, our waiter and Vladimir were extremely accommodating. There was a good variety of eggs prepared many ways, fresh greens,and other brunch like food. Coffee & cappuccino were very good. A Bloody Mary and Bellini was enjoyed by us."
195,"Upper West side Columbus Avenue and 85th street it's real gem a good local neighborhood place, food is a superb , great decor wonderful service and friendly people. A pleasant place you'd love to hang out and enjoy your evening highly recommended."
196,"I don't usually bother writing negative reviews unless they are outstanding, and I do wish the restaurant well in improving. My experience was only brunch, but we had a variety of dishes with everyone dissatisfied. The food was bland, the serving sizes small for the price (and no, I'm not into supersized servings, but for the price they were small....) and they couldn't serve tap water? Plates were not the correct size for the food, no ANYTHING offered as starters while you wait for food. Cocktails nothing special, but pretty presentation. On the plus size it seems this spot added a new bathroom with its new ownership. With so many places to brunch in this neighborhood, if you're into tasty food, this isn't the place- go to a diner. A shame because it's a wonderful light-filled spacious place. Perhaps their other menus deserve a chance, but I'll be skipping on account of the general ""we don't really care"" vibe I got from here."
197,"Came here for the first time with a friend. Cocktails were amazing (French 85 , 3 shades of green) We had escargots, foie gras, rib eye, branzino. Everything was really good and well priced. Service was really dedicated. We had a really good time and will definitely come back."
198,"This replaced an excellent place that was there for years, good quality food, decor nowhere near as impressive, but solid addition nonetheless"
199,"You enter The Consulate, and You’re immediately greeted with friendly welcoming smiles. You’re the lead to go a grand spacious dining room with a beautiful Christmas Tree, where smiles continues as your server approaches. We ordered sparkling water and four special cocktails The Consulate Old Fashionated, Fantasy Foliage, Oui Mademoiselle and The French 85. Our selection appetizers for the table was Hand Cut Steak Tartare, Escargots, Buffalo Sweet Breads and White Salad. From the Wine List We select to drink Château La Nerthe, Châteauneuf Du Pape 2015 French Red Wine, and for White Wine The Sommelier opened another French Selection Vieilles Vignes, Domaine Bachelet Ramonet 2017. Our Profesional Server Draco He was performing a great job, serving food, wine and awesome table maintenance. Holy Foodie Haven, The Main Course arrived, every dish impressed, My Mother ordered Lobster And Lemongrass Risotto, My Wife ordered Seared Arctic Char, My Father ordered Grilled Rib Eye Medium Rare, His meat was cooked perfectly and I ordered Steak Frites Medium Rare, and also was cooked the way I ordered; for Side Dishes We got Creamed Spinach, Barbecue Corn, Seared Brussels Sprouts With Bacon And Red Wine Vinegar and Grilled Broccolini, Preserved Lemon. After We finished our meal We ordered four Decaf Skim Cappuccinos, and told our Server Draco To Thanks The Chef And His Team for the Delicious Meal We Enjoyed and how Happy My Family Feels In The Restaurant. After 10 minutes The Chef Alan Show Up In the table and We Thanks Him In Person. The Chef send Four Desserts on the house Creme Brûlée, Apple Tart, Molten Chocolate Lava Cake and tres leches. Yummy Yummy Delicious, and for the perfect match We ordered Two Expresso Martinis, One Boulevardier And One Mudslide. It was a lovely experience from the beginning to end. Definitely our favorite French Restaurant In the Upper Westside. Happy Holidays To All The Profesional Staff Of The Consulate French Restaurant."
200,"My gf and I wanted to check out this new restaurant in UWS, so we got to the bar. Jelena and Milan are absolutely awesome hosts, and pro mixologists. The cocktail list is incredible as is their happy hour menu. Flatbreads are a must have! The truffle flatbread delicious and the happy hour price is lovely. My gf had the touch of ginger and I had the fantasy foliage- the drinks are really well made. I’m a tequila, mescal drinker, and I really liked my gf’s drink (even though I hate burbon). The restaurant is overall very beautiful, and they had great lounge music playing. If you want to come and have a nice relaxed time here, you must check it out."
201,"I looked forward to trying this new entrant on Columbus Ave. Sadly it was an expensive disappointment. The restaurant was beautifully decorated for the holidays, and the owner circulated, though only to certain tables. The maître d was curt when I had difficulty understanding what she said because of the overall noise level and her accent. The service was slow and inattentive. Tables are so close together it was very difficult to get in and out and wait staff had difficulty serving some diners.  My friends were happy with their entrées but I ordered the Caesar salad. It was a small head of romaine lettuce cut in 4 pieces with thick, store-bought quality dressing poured on top. For $17 it was both poor quality and poor value. None of the staff noticed I left 3/4 of the salad on my plate."
202,"We were three for brunch. The room was attractive, though crowded and noisy at 1:45PM. Nevertheless, we were seated swiftly and our drink orders were taken immediately. Service was surprisingly attentive, and even the chef asked if everything was satisfactory. The food was delicious. The grilled tuna sandwich on crusty peasant bread, served with guacamole and fries was superb. What a great combination. My companions were equally happy with their choices: Nutella French toast with strawberries; and the ""hangover"" hamburger arrived very rare (as ordered) with a fried egg and lots of accoutrements on top. As the place emptied out, we could finally hear ourselves talk! We will be back, for sure."
203,"The name and concept of this place is a poor facsimile of the original restaurant The Consulate in Atlanta (in the state of Georgia established in 2013 with over 500 Google reviews and over 600 Open Table reviews). Trying to to benefit off riding the success of a well known existing restaurant is incredibly misleading and makes me question their quality and service. Considering the climate of restaurants in NYC, I don't expect this establishment to be open for very long."
204,"Wonderful space, friendly staff, exceptional food (no exceptions from entree to main course) Very decent prices.I warmly recommend !!!"
205,"A jewel in Upper West Side New York. French-new American food, great cocktails, intimate and stylish decor. Paris meet Manhattan! Thank you for the amazing experience, The Consulate crew!"
206,"The place is wonderful! Great wine,delicious food,service is professional ,attentive and very friendly! We ordered the Truffle Pasta and the Burata.The both dishes were delicious! Highly recommended !!!"
207,Tried this place the other day and we were very satisfied with their menu options and their service! Everyone was very polite and tried to accommodate our needs. As a food lover I chose the sauteed shrimps in chili garlic and the Pasta with sardines. All was fantastic! Will try to visit it again!
208,You should try this place and as well you should try their Fluke crudo app! This was something really good to have after a work day! Also try their Nathalie cocktail! I had like 2 and cannot wait to have another one on my next visit! Great service!
209,"Kind & efficient service for an otherwise classic fare. We tried their brunch menu and dishes were generally good, with portions on the tiny side though.  Overall a good option but a tad expensive for what you get at brunch time. Dinner might be more elaborate though !"
210,"Refreshing to have a new brasserie on the UWS. Great bar, always happy to wait for a table sipping a Martini as was the case tonight. Some teething issues, awful ""Wonderbread"" but I'm sure this was a week one miscalculation. The place was packed. Martini was excellent, the Crudo delicious, the flatbread satisfying. We will be back!"
211,"This place recently opened up so few of us stopped by to check it out. They have a good selection of drinks (beer, wine and cocktails) with mainstream options but also few different options worth checking out. Food is delicious, everything from appetizers, main dishes, and especially desserts. Might just be the best restaurant in the neighborhood. We will be back!!"
212,"The Consulate is a consummate example of hospitality - a delicious, inviting blend of amazing food, excellent wine choices, an inviting and relaxing atmosphere, and a team of seamless professionals who keep hospitality at the fore.  When considering drinks, we were drawn in immediately by beverage director Igor's wine list! Throughout the evening, he generously and personably added to the stellar service provided by our server Steve (and the rest of the team).  We tried the octopus as an appetizer, which was fantastic. So tender, great flavors - so good!  I had the short rib cavatelli with ricotta, which was just as sinfully sumptuous as you'd expect from the title. The portion size was generous, and yet the dish retained some illusion of lightness... so I felt I could just keep eating and eating. Perfectly cooked cavatelli commingled with tender flavorful short rib, the sauciness at the bottom, the ricotta on the top... and floating on there was a dreamy compliment of dill, which I wouldn't have expected and yet so enjoyed!  My mother had the skate, which was tasty and tender. The slight crispness around the edges, the capers, a bright lemony sauce, and greens were immaculate. I imagine the UWS will truly appreciate the nod to classic cuisine here; it was an artfully simple classic dish.  Desserts were similarly tasty, from an inventive tres leche to a fudgy, silky smooth chocolate creation that grasped the fine line of being the perfect amount of sweet. And if you're at all a dessert aficionado, do yourself the favor of pairing with a dessert wine.... the 20yr tawny port was smooth smooth smooth.  This restaurant checks off all the boxes, from the beautiful relaxing glowy/spacious/classy yet comfortable ambiance, to the fantastically knowledgeable, genuinely pleasant, and truly hospitable team. It's a dream and I can't recommend it enough! Go! And send your friends!"
213,"Beautiful and stylish new restaurant, remainded me of a speak easy era, food and drinks are this quality are not to be found here in UWS, and customer service is going above and beyond, definitely will be back."
214,"As a corporate-business traveler in last 20 years, I have been enjoying food in the finest restaurants all over the World and the US, and one thing that I learn to appreciate the most, apart from amazing food and ambiance, is genuine customer care, that I experienced at the Consulate. Discovering at the same location perfect balance of a fine food and stuff that makes you feel “at home” is exceedingly unique and truly priceless. They will make your cocktails perfect, too!"
215,"It's been a while since I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, and The Consulate managed to surprise me. We had the Ribeye and Wild Mushrooms + Truffle Pasta - both were amazing. We also had their chocolate cake dessert and a Creme Brulee.  Highly recommend."
216,"Every bite and sip is to come back for! Had an amazing experience! So happy to have you as our neighbors! Best of luck to you! Friendly and caring people! Thank you, Igor, Milan, Mickey! Thank you Sanya and Chris! Thank you, Chef! We will be back often! Just keep this great performance and execution on the same level and people will love you!"
217,"Upon arrival we were received by a very friendly hostess that led the way to our table. Once sat down, a waiter came up to us and handed us the menus. We went for the onion soup and the beef tartar as our entrees; amazing is an understatement. After having finished our entrees, we proceeded with the main course: mushroom pasta and rib eye steak. It was extraordinary: the meat was cooked perfectly, as demanded, it was accompanied by perfectly cooked potatoes and a butter-based dip. They also have an outstanding collection of wine: I went for a French wine that our waiter had recommended. I can only say: well done. It went perfectly well with the meal I had ordered. The food was an easy 10/10, so as the service and the hospitality. Altogether, an amazing experience. Would definitely recommend."
